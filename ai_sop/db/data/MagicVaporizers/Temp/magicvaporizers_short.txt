Why do I need a vaporizer?
You might already be aware that using a vaporizer to consume herbs is healthier than to burn them, but that is just one of many benefits. Not only will your body thank you, but as vaporizing is an extremely effective method you will end up with more money for herbs too. Vapour also smells a lot less, doesn’t stick to furniture or wallpaper and will dissipate in a lot shorter time than smoke, meaning you will have more opportunities for your herb consumption.
Get a vaporizer with adjustable temperature and you will discover that different temperatures produce different effects and flavours. With a vaporizer you can always get consistent results and decide if you want to go for full flavours or maximum extraction. Once you have decided to step in to the world of vaporizers, get ready for a wide range of choices and options to consider.
Finding the right vaporizer for you
Before we dive into the specifics of vaporizers, let's start off with covering the basics. The three most common types of vaporizers are e-cigs, dry herb vaporizer and concentrate vaporizers. If you are looking for an e-cig (for e-juices), try another Google search as you won’t find those in our shop. If you are interested in getting a dry herb, or concentrate vaporizer, well done, you have come to the right place.
Instead of burning your herbs to smoke and ashes, dry herb vaporizers gently extract the active ingredients from your herbs, resulting in a strong and aromatic vapour. A vaporizer will never heat your herbs to their burning point, but the higher the temperature, the stronger the effects are.
Think through where you plan to use your vaporizer the most. If you plan on using it at home only, we recommend you to get a stationary vaporizer. These vaporizers connect to an electrical outlet and are for that reason the most powerful ones. There are many types, some useable by a whip, some useable by balloons and even some with both (the Volcano Hybrid and the Arizer Extreme Q).
If you don’t want to be bound to an electrical outlet for your vaporizer sessions you are looking for a portable vaporizer. The dry herb vaporizers we have in our selection are some of the best available on the market and there are good options for every price point. Consider the vaporizer’s heating type, heat-up time, battery life and size before you make your choice. If you want the best however, you can’t go wrong with the Mighty+ vaporizer.

What is a vaporizer?
A vaporizer is a device that can heat up materials like herbs and concentrates to a high enough temperature that they release their active ingredients into vapour that is then inhaled. The material never gets hot enough to combust, meaning they produce no smoke or carcinogens.
How does a vaporizer work?
Vaporizers use conduction heating, convection heating or both (hybrid). Conduction heating means the material is heated through direct contact with a hot surface, and convection heating means the material is heated by hot air passing through it. If you want full flavours go for convection and if you want maximum extraction go for conduction.
How to use a vaporizer?
The process is very easy and normally goes like this:
Grind your herbs to small pieces (preferably with a grinder).
Fill the heating chamber of your vaporizer with your ground herbs.
Start your vaporizer and select your desired temperature.
Wait for your vaporizer to heat up, usually less than 30 seconds.
Inhale the delicious vapour your vaporizer now produces!
How much does a vaporizer cost?
They can cost anywhere from £40 up to £500 depending on the features such as heat-up time, temperature control, battery capacity, heating type, size, warranty time, what they can vaporize and a lot more.
What vaporizer should I buy?
First you have to determine how you would use it. Will you only use it at home? Get a stationary vaporizer like the Volcano Hybrid. Want to be able to bring it with you? Get a portable vape like the Mighty vape.
Which is the best vaporizer?
Our top 5 favourites right now are:
Mighty+ vaporizer – The most powerful portable vaporizer
Tinymight 2 – Convection heating at its best
XMax V3 Pro – Affordable and reliable
Angus Vaporizer – Innovative halogen heating
Volcano Hybrid – The king of stationary vaporizers
How to clean a vaporizer?
You should regularly clean out the chamber and mouthpiece with a brush, but if you want to do a deep clean of your vaporizer you should soak the detachable parts in isopropyl alcohol. Leave them submerged in alcohol overnight and rinse them with warm water the day after.
