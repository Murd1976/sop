Why do I need a vaporizer?
You might already be aware that using a vaporizer to consume herbs is healthier than to burn them, but that is just one of many benefits. Not only will your body thank you, but as vaporizing is an extremely effective method you will end up with more money for herbs too. Vapour also smells a lot less, doesn’t stick to furniture or wallpaper and will dissipate in a lot shorter time than smoke, meaning you will have more opportunities for your herb consumption.
Get a vaporizer with adjustable temperature and you will discover that different temperatures produce different effects and flavours. With a vaporizer you can always get consistent results and decide if you want to go for full flavours or maximum extraction. Once you have decided to step in to the world of vaporizers, get ready for a wide range of choices and options to consider.
Finding the right vaporizer for you
Before we dive into the specifics of vaporizers, let's start off with covering the basics. The three most common types of vaporizers are e-cigs, dry herb vaporizer and concentrate vaporizers. If you are looking for an e-cig (for e-juices), try another Google search as you won’t find those in our shop. If you are interested in getting a dry herb, or concentrate vaporizer, well done, you have come to the right place.
Instead of burning your herbs to smoke and ashes, dry herb vaporizers gently extract the active ingredients from your herbs, resulting in a strong and aromatic vapour. A vaporizer will never heat your herbs to their burning point, but the higher the temperature, the stronger the effects are.
Think through where you plan to use your vaporizer the most. If you plan on using it at home only, we recommend you to get a stationary vaporizer. These vaporizers connect to an electrical outlet and are for that reason the most powerful ones. There are many types, some useable by a whip, some useable by balloons and even some with both (the Volcano Hybrid and the Arizer Extreme Q).
If you don’t want to be bound to an electrical outlet for your vaporizer sessions you are looking for a portable vaporizer. The dry herb vaporizers we have in our selection are some of the best available on the market and there are good options for every price point. Consider the vaporizer’s heating type, heat-up time, battery life and size before you make your choice. If you want the best however, you can’t go wrong with the Mighty+ vaporizer.

What is a vaporizer?
A vaporizer is a device that can heat up materials like herbs and concentrates to a high enough temperature that they release their active ingredients into vapour that is then inhaled. The material never gets hot enough to combust, meaning they produce no smoke or carcinogens.
How does a vaporizer work?
Vaporizers use conduction heating, convection heating or both (hybrid). Conduction heating means the material is heated through direct contact with a hot surface, and convection heating means the material is heated by hot air passing through it. If you want full flavours go for convection and if you want maximum extraction go for conduction.
How to use a vaporizer?
The process is very easy and normally goes like this:
Grind your herbs to small pieces (preferably with a grinder).
Fill the heating chamber of your vaporizer with your ground herbs.
Start your vaporizer and select your desired temperature.
Wait for your vaporizer to heat up, usually less than 30 seconds.
Inhale the delicious vapour your vaporizer now produces!
How much does a vaporizer cost?
They can cost anywhere from £40 up to £500 depending on the features such as heat-up time, temperature control, battery capacity, heating type, size, warranty time, what they can vaporize and a lot more.
What vaporizer should I buy?
First you have to determine how you would use it. Will you only use it at home? Get a stationary vaporizer like the Volcano Hybrid. Want to be able to bring it with you? Get a portable vape like the Mighty vape.
Which is the best vaporizer?
Our top 5 favourites right now are:
Mighty+ vaporizer – The most powerful portable vaporizer
Tinymight 2 – Convection heating at its best
XMax V3 Pro – Affordable and reliable
Angus Vaporizer – Innovative halogen heating
Volcano Hybrid – The king of stationary vaporizers
How to clean a vaporizer?
You should regularly clean out the chamber and mouthpiece with a brush, but if you want to do a deep clean of your vaporizer you should soak the detachable parts in isopropyl alcohol. Leave them submerged in alcohol overnight and rinse them with warm water the day after.

What is a vaporizer?
A vaporizer is a device that can heat up materials like herbs and concentrates to a high enough temperature that they release their active ingredients into vapour that is then inhaled. The material never gets hot enough to combust, meaning they produce no smoke or carcinogens.
How does a vaporizer work?
Vaporizers use conduction heating, convection heating or both (hybrid). Conduction heating means the material is heated through direct contact with a hot surface, and convection heating means the material is heated by hot air passing through it. If you want full flavours go for convection and if you want maximum extraction go for conduction.
How to use a vaporizer?
The process is very easy and normally goes like this:
Grind your herbs to small pieces (preferably with a grinder).
Fill the heating chamber of your vaporizer with your ground herbs.
Start your vaporizer and select your desired temperature.
Wait for your vaporizer to heat up, usually less than 30 seconds.
Inhale the delicious vapour your vaporizer now produces!
How much does a vaporizer cost?
They can cost anywhere from £40 up to £500 depending on the features such as heat-up time, temperature control, battery capacity, heating type, size, warranty time, what they can vaporize and a lot more.
What vaporizer should I buy?
First you have to determine how you would use it. Will you only use it at home? Get a stationary vaporizer like the Volcano Hybrid. Want to be able to bring it with you? Get a portable vape like the Mighty vape.
Which is the best vaporizer?
Our top 5 favourites right now are:
Mighty+ vaporizer – The most powerful portable vaporizer
Tinymight 2 – Convection heating at its best
XMax V3 Pro – Affordable and reliable
Angus Vaporizer – Innovative halogen heating
Volcano Hybrid – The king of stationary vaporizers
How to clean a vaporizer?
You should regularly clean out the chamber and mouthpiece with a brush, but if you want to do a deep clean of your vaporizer you should soak the detachable parts in isopropyl alcohol. Leave them submerged in alcohol overnight and rinse them with warm water the day after.

When you are on the search for a high-quality vaporizer, it’s easy to find yourself overwhelmed with all the options available today. As such, there are times when you need to sift through the underwhelming and shoot straight to the top.
That’s precisely what our bestsellers are. These vapes are the best of the best. There are no questionable devices among them. Instead, you get top-of-the-line features and exceptional vapour quality with every unit.
Volcano Hybrid
If you’re looking for the absolute best in stationary vaping, the Volcano Hybrid won’t disappoint. By using cutting-edge technology, you can look forward to an excellent vaping experience. Thanks to a sleek design and user-friendly controls, it’s no wonder why this device ranks so highly.
Made by the German company Storz & Bickel, you expect typical German engineering, which is remarkable, to say the least. As such, this is a stationary vape that is built to last. Only premium components are used in the manufacturing of this vaporizer, and it shows.
Those looking for the best vapour will definitely want to check out this stellar unit. You even get touch-sensitive buttons to control the Hybrid, making it a must-have for anyone who wants the latest and greatest in the vaping industry.
Mighty Vaporizer
The Mighty Vaporizer is just the unit for you if you’re looking for a premium vaporizer that fits in the palm of your hand. It’s a bit large for a portable vaporizer, but that’s only because it’s so robust. Packed with features and built like a tank, you can look forward to buying a vape that is built to last for years.
The Mighty comes loaded with features to ensure that you get an unforgettable vaping session every time. And unlike other vapes, the Mighty comes with an amazing control system that makes it easy to get accurate and precise temperatures with every use.

Why Dry Herb Vaporizers?
There’s a lot to be lost when your herbs are heated up using traditional smoking methods. Not only do you burn up an unnecessary amount of your valuable herbs, but you lose out on taste and aroma, as well. If you cherish your herbs, you’re going to want to stick to vaping. Why?
When you use a dry herb vaporizer, your herbs are heated at lower temperatures. In fact, only the required amount of heat is used. And in doing so, you don’t end up wasting away your herbs. This happens when other heating methods are used instead of a vaporizer.
Similar to loading a pipe, you simply load up how much herb you want, activate your dry herb vape, and enjoy the high-quality vapour. As mentioned, it not only smells better, but it tastes better, too. The difference is night and day and one that you’re going to want to experience if you haven’t already.
We offer a wide variety of dry herb vapes that are to please everyone. No matter what your needs and preferences are, we’re sure that we’ve got a dry herb vape for you. Feel free to shoot us a line if you have any questions about our extensive line of vapes.
Stationary Dry Herb Vaporizers
As the name indicates stationary vaporizers are meant to stay in mostly the same place, and that is due to their size and that they need electricity from an outlet. Even though you lose some flexibility, in return you get access to the most powerful heating and you never have to worry about charging batteries.
Stationary vaporizers are for people who enjoy bigger bowls and vaping in the comfort of the home. Some stationary vaporizers use a balloon to add the vapour to first, while others let you take a hit from a whip. Some, like the Arizer Extreme Q and Volcano Hybrid lets you do both!
Portable Dry Herb Vaporizers
Want to use your vaporizer when you are outside? How about a portable dry herb vaporizer that fits in your pocket! Although they aren’t as powerful or durable, portable vaporizers are extremely convenient. With a portable vaporizer you can enjoy vapour anywhere, whether it’s to your friend's house or on a trip.
Before getting a portable dry herb vaporizer you have a lot of choices to consider as manufacturers continually innovate and improve. Look out for choices like digital temperature control, removable batteries, smartphone apps, special heating profiles, and a lot more.
Best Dry Herb Vaporizers
Even though it's hard to determine what is the best dry herb vaporizer for you, we have selected two of our favourites we think you should give an extra look:
DynaVap M
If you value your privacy and want a dry herb vape that you can easily conceal, the DynaVap M is the perfect addition to your collection. Made from beautiful stainless steel and built to last, this durable yet lightweight unit is no bigger than a pen!
As a manually controlled dry herb vape, you get to choose what kind of heating is used to vape your herb. Feel free to use a blowtorch or lighter – whatever suits you best. You’ll know when you have reached the necessary temperature, as the DynaVap M is equipped with a clicking cap that makes a sound when ready.
It’s ideal for slipping in your pocket yet offers a quality vaping experience through and through. You’ll also find a handy bowl that accommodates micro-dosing on the go. Perhaps best of all, you can pick up this portable dry herb vape at a budget-friendly price. It’s tough, convenient, and easy to use. What more could you ask for?
Mighty Vaporizer
The Mighty Vaporizer is one of the most popular portable dry herb vaporizers on the market, and we’re pleased to offer it to you. If you’re looking for power and flexibility, this is the device for you. Not only is it made of the highest quality, with premium components and durable construction, but it also offers truly exceptional vapour.
When you use this dry herb vaporizer, you are in control of how much heat is used to vape your herbs. What’s more, you can look forward to incredible battery life when you choose the Mighty Vaporizer. In fact, you get 120 minutes of continuous vaping power on a single charge!
But be warned; the Mighty is mighty large. If you’re looking for optimal portability, you might want to look into a different unit. Its massive size makes it hard to slip into your pocket. That said, it will fit into a bag or purse just fine.
Considering the exceptional vaping experience that the Mighty delivers, the larger size is understandable and acceptable by all who use it. It’s a bit more pricey than other dry herb vapes, but the quality is top of the line and worth the price of admission.
Summary
We encourage you to check out the rest of MagicVaporizers for all of your vaping needs. We are pleased to share our extensive selection of vaporizers with you, as we are sure you will appreciate all that we have to offer.
You will find plenty of dry herb vaporizers, portable devices, and stationary vapes to fit your needs. If you have any questions about any of our products, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

What Is Concentrate?
Just as their name suggests, concentrate vaporizers allow you to vape concentrated forms of herb. This can come in the form of wax or oil depending on what you’re vaping.
If you’re a beginner who is interested in trying vaping for the first time, concentrates may prove to be too powerful for you. As such, it’s usually better to stick with dry herbs to start and work your way up. This will ensure that you have an enjoyable experience and not get too much of a good thing all at once.
With that said, concentrate vaporizers are the more cost-effective solution, as they require far less product to be used. And on top of that, you’re going to get a greater effect from concentrates. But again, you shouldn’t jump right into them.
Even seasoned vapers sometimes find concentrates to be too potent. Proceed with caution and use good judgment, and you’ll have enjoyable vaping sessions.
Our Most Popular Concentrate Vaporizers
From Boundless Technology’s stellar Boundless CFX to Storz & Bickel’s groundbreaking Volcano Classic, there is a wealth of options for you to choose from. As per our strict policy, we carry only the highest-quality vapes, and that applies to concentrates, too.
So no matter which concentrate vape you decide to buy from us, you can trust that you’re getting a reliable unit, regardless of your price range.
Boundless CFX
The Boundless CFX is an excellent investment if you’re trying to learn how to use a concentrate vaporizer. It’s even ideal for seasoned users who are already familiar with oils and waxes. That’s the appeal of the Boundless CFX.
It’s incredibly easy to use but offers more than enough features to ensure quality vaping sessions every time. One of the most notable attributes of this concentrate vape is its ability to heat up in just 20 seconds.
You get a colour OLED display that keeps you apprised of the temperature at all times, as well. Simplistic yet effective buttons let you adjust the temperature, giving you full control over how much heat is used on your products.
You can use both concentrates and dry herbs, allowing you to switch back and forth as you please without having to carry a separate device. It’s not the smallest vape around, but it’s still pretty compact for everything that it does.
Even more impressive is the stellar battery life. A single full charge will give you 15 five-minute vaping sessions. And when you need to plug and recharge, it takes just 30 minutes to top off! Now that’s convenient.
Volcano Hybrid from Storz & Bickel
As one of the most technologically advanced stationary vaporizers on the market, the Volcano Hybrid delivers 40-second heating for on-the-spot vaping sessions. A digital display with touch-sensitive buttons serves as your user interface.
Although simple and to the point, it’s the perfect design and is sure to accommodate both beginners and experts. The construction of the Hybrid is exceptional, offering incredible durability while looking sleek and stylish.
What’s more, Storz & Bickel equipped the Hybrid with Bluetooth technology. Thanks to this addition, you can connect your smartphone to the concentrate vaporizer via a downloadable app (Android and iOS). From there, you’ll be able to freely control the vape with your device.
While the Volcano Hybrid is pricier than other concentrate vapes, you’ll have a hard time finding its equal. Vapour quality is most excellent, delivering a smooth experience with every use. If you want a vaporizer that you can count to last, the Volcano Hybrid has you covered.
Flowermate Aura
We carry budget-friendly concentrate vapes, as well, such as the Aura from Flowermate. Thanks to its entry-level price and versatile performance, you’re sure to get plenty of use from this little device.
It’s capable of vaping dry herbs, waxes, and oils. For such a compact unit, the Aura boasts impressive battery life. On just a single charge, you can get two hours of use. The portability of this device makes it ideal for vaping on the go. Just slip it in your pocket, and it remains hidden away until you’re ready to vape.
There’s a nice safety feature built into the Aura, as well, ensuring that it doesn’t accidentally turn on whilst in your pocket. To activate the Aura, you’ll need to press the power button five times in a row to get it to turn on and heat up.
If you’re trying to save money but need a reliable concentrate vaporizer, the Flowermate Aura won’t disappoint.

How to Select A Portable Vaporizer
You’ve been reading about portable vaporizers, and you think you’re ready to make an investment. Before you do, there are some very important factors you want to consider. If you’re new to vaporizers in general, it’s easy to get in over your head.
Or worse, you could end up falling for a lot of empty hype and wasting your hard-earned money on a disappointing device. Sadly, this happens all too often. And when it does, it usually leaves a bad taste in the buyer’s mouth – both figuratively and literally.
As a result, they are turned off to what could have been an enjoyable (and enlightening) experience. Fortunately, you have us to walk you through the buying process so that this doesn’t happen to you. Below is a handy outline of what you should consider before investing in a portable vaporizer.
By asking yourself the following, you’ll find it much easier to determine what you need.
What’s My Budget?
Obviously, you don’t want to waste your time and energy shopping for a portable vaporizer that you know you can’t afford. As such, you want to start out by crunching some numbers to better establish how much you’re going to be able to spend on a vape.
When you have determined the exact amount of money that’s going to go toward a portable vaporizer, you can start looking through our vast selection of devices. With the budget you’ve set aside in your head, you’ll be able to eliminate vapes that are out of your price range.
When you have narrowed it down to the units you can afford, you’ll be able to proceed to the next factor. The great thing about our product selection is that, when you click on each one, you’re presented with a detailed description of what it has to offer.
Thanks to this, you’ll find it to be easier than ever to narrow down the right portable vaporizer for your needs. But before you do that, let’s look at the next feature to consider.
What Kind of Portability Do I Need?
While they are called portable vaporizers, some are more portable than others. If you are someone who is often on the go, whether it’s travelling or just exploring your surroundings, you’re going to find a compact vaporizer to be a better fit for your lifestyle.
A unit like the PAX 3 is a fine example of quality and portability rolled into one. Although you lose some customisation offered by larger units like the famous Mighty, many users appreciate the slimmer design of the PAX 3.
With that said, if you find that you tend to stay put and want a portable vaporizer that you can enjoy in the comfort of your home, there’s a good chance that you will find a heftier vape to be to your liking. Why? Because you typically get more features since there is more room to include them.
What Vaping Features Are Important to Me?
As we discussed above, many portable vaporizers come equipped with a variety of features to enhance your vaping experience. Digital temperature control, for example, affords you greater versatility over your herb’s heating.
You will likely need to opt for a larger portable vaporizer in this instance, such as the Boundless CFX. This particular model not only provides you with plenty of features, but you can also look forward to a user-friendly interface that anyone can learn.
Consider which features are important to you and use that as a guide to help you narrow down your top choices. Then, proceed to the next buying factor.
What Vapour Quality Do I Want?
Quality vapour is a big deal to many consumers. If you want to be sure you’re getting the most from your herb, it’s a good idea to opt for a portable vaporizer that features glass in its construction. Take the Arizer Solo 2. This advanced vape comes equipped with a pure glass air path for optimal taste and aroma.
Another important thing to consider that affects the vapour quality is the heating method. Portable vaporizers heat the material through conduction heating, convection heating, or a mix of both (hybrid). Convection heating usually generates more flavourful vapour, but it's not as efficient as conduction heating so you will have to choose if you prefer maximum flavour over maximum extraction or if you go for a mix of both.
Is Battery Life Essential for My Needs?
If you’re on the move a lot, you’re probably not going to have access to a charger as often as you’d like. As such, it’s extremely important to consider the battery life of your portable vaporizer unless you go for an option like the DynaVap M that is heated by an external source (not to mention a budget-friendly price and slim design).
That’s where you need to think about how much travelling you typically do and how much you plan on doing after buying a vaporizer. If you prefer the home life, the battery isn’t going to concern you as much as someone constantly on the go.
If you’re in the latter group of people, aim for vapes that come with long-lasting battery life. In doing so, you can look forward to using your portable vaporizer for extended periods of time.
Summary
Here at MagicVaporizers, we offer a huge selection of high-quality portable vaporizers that fit a variety of needs, budgets, and uses. Packed with features and built to the highest standards, there’s a portable vape for everybody.
Be sure to explore our vast online catalogue of devices and implement the questions above when you do. You will have a much easier time narrowing down the portable vaporizer of your dreams.

Benefits of Stationary Vapes
There’s no question that the vaporizer market is thriving. What started as a unique entry back in 2000 has since become a must-have device for anyone who enjoys herbs. We’re talking about stationary vaporizers.
Although you’re going to spend more on the outset, the benefits of a stationary vaporizer justify the investment. Once you get it set up and get accustomed to using it, you’ll be amazed at how much money a stationary vaporizer saves you over time.
As mentioned, these devices don’t require batteries like their portable counterparts. As such, you needn’t bother with charging up. But there are other benefits to look forward to, as well.
Power
Stationary vapes offer more power than that of portable devices. Units like the Volcano Classic deliver higher temperatures, better draw resistance, and all-around improved vapour quality. And it’s all thanks to the powerful components used in the construction of stationary vaporizers.
Accurate Heating
Vape tech continues to improve with each passing year. That said, it can still be challenging to get accurate temperatures across all vaporizers. With stationary vaporizers, however, you’re going to get precision heating unlike any other.
Balloons/Whips
There are two primary methods of extracting vapour from stationary vapes: balloons and whips. Balloons were first introduced by Storz & Bickel when it came out with the now-famous Volcano, the stationary vaporizer that started it all.
This method works by attaching a balloon to the vape. You then fill it up, remove it, and inhale the vapour from the balloon via a mouthpiece.
Whips, on the other hand, attach to the vaporizer in order to deliver vapour to the mouthpiece. Both methods ensure a powerful experience, although balloons are often preferred over whips.
Bigger Chambers
When using portable vaporizers, you are admittedly limited in how much herb you can use at any given time. All that changes when you switch over to stationary vapes. Because of their larger sizes, it’s a given that you’re going to benefit from bigger chambers, as well.
With a bigger chamber you will be able to use more herbs as you please and you can look forward to longer sessions in the comfort and privacy of your own home.
Stationary Vapes to Look For
There are many high-quality stationary devices available today that are sure to impress. However, a few stands out from the crowd. As already mentioned, the Volcano was an instant classic that remains one of the most sought-after stationary vapes on the market.
But there are others you should look into, as well. Let’s take a closer look at the Volcano and explore some other heavy hitters to give you a better idea of what you can expect.
Storz & Bickel’s Volcano Classic
This is the unit responsible for starting a revolution. From top to bottom, Storz & Bickel delivers a quality vaporizer that is made with premium components. As a balloon vape, you’re going to get some truly exceptional vapour from the Volcano Classic.
The quality and consistency of performance are second to none, ensuring that you’re investing in a stationary vaporizer that’s not only built to last but more than capable of satisfying your herbal desires.
Arizer’s Extreme Q
Designed to accommodate both balloons and whips, Arizer’s Extreme Q is just the ticket if you’re looking to save while still getting stellar quality. What’s more, this stationary vape is ideal for beginners thanks to its simple ease of use.
But don’t let that deter you if you fancy yourself an experienced vaper. The Extreme Q offers plenty of customization in your vaping sessions without compromising quality. The temperature is accurate, too, so you can expect consistent heating every time.
Storz & Bickel’s Volcano Hybrid
Armed with a digital display and touch controls, the Volcano Hybrid offers ultra-fast heating for no-nonsense vaping. You can even download a mobile app for remote control! Adjusting the temperature from your smartphone means better versatility than ever before.
The quality of the Volcano Hybrid follows Storz & Bickel’s famously premium designs, ensuring that this stationary vape is built to last. But the quality doesn’t end there. The vapour that this device produces is smooth, flavourful, and packed with savoury aromas.
If you want the absolute best in your vaping sessions, the Volcano Hybrid won’t disappoint. It’s more costly than most other models, but you can’t beat its performance and construction.

Who is the Mighty+ (Plus) for?
The Storz and Bickel Mighty+ is a dry herb vaporizer that delivers the same great vapour quality as the original Mighty, but with USB-C charging and a faster heat-up time.
It's still straightforward and easy to use, with a just three buttons to control the heating, which means it's a great vape both for beginners who will appreciate its simplicity and for expert users that can take full advantage of its incredible heating power and durability.
Improved design
The new design of the Mighty+ makes it perfect for everyday use. The filling chamber now has a ceramic coating which means that your herbs will taste even better. Another highly requested feature are the new fins that are discretely placed on the bottom to allow it to stand upright for when it’s not being used or connected to a water tool.
The ultimate way to heat your herbs or concentrate
The Mighty+'s patented heating technology with conduction and convection heating combined heats up herb or concentrate efficiently and evenly without having to be stirred. Unlike the original, it also features an optimized heater that warms-up in 60 seconds or less.
Experiment with temperatures
Because you have the option to select any temperature between 40°C and 210°C, you can fully customize your vaping experience with the Mighty+ vaporizer!
Storz & Bickel also added an additional temperature changing option. Triple-clicking the On-Off button will automatically increase the current temperature by 15°C and allows you to switch between temperatures much more quickly than before.
Even faster charging
The new USB-C port with the “Supercharge” function on The Mighty+ will allow you to charge the two 3300 mAh batteries up to 80% in just 40 minutes. You can now fast-charge your device anywhere, allowing you more time vaping instead of charging.
It also features pass-through charging which means you can use the Mighty+ while it's charging!
Quality certified
The Mighty+ is the first ever dry herb vaporizer to gain UL certification. Sleep easy in the knowledge that a third party safety certification company has inspected all of its electrical, battery and heating systems!
Warranty
All Mighty+ vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty + 1 extra year after registration, restricted to normal use.

Who is the XMax V3 Pro for?
XMax designed the V3 Pro for people who want a budget-friendly, lightweight vape that is highly portable and discreet. Thanks to the slim design it excels in portability which is perfect if you're outside a lot or just looking for something easy to handle in your hand or pocket.
XMax V3 Pro is also versatile as it can vaporize herbs as well as concentrate. The full convection heating combined with the fast heat-up time and easy-to-use interface, make this an excellent vape for most users.
On-demand convection vapour
New for this version of the XMax Pro is the on-demand mode. This mode only heats the herbs/concentrates for 30 seconds at a time. This reduces waste as you only heat the oven (0,15 g capacity) when you are using the vape. Though, if you prefer the oven to stay heated, you can always use the session mode instead (4 or 6 minutes).
As XMax V3 Pro is a convection vape, this means that the heat applied to the herbs/concentrates will be through hot air. This gives you a better flavour, more evenly vaped material, and more vapour when compared to conduction vapes that have direct contact with the material being vaped. After the vapour is produced, it’s then led through an isolated air path (no contact with electronics/metal) before reaching the mouthpiece.
Fast to heat up
With the XMax V3 Pro, you can select any temperature you want from 100 to 220°C, with a 1°C precision. If you enjoy smooth, flavourful vapour you should use the temperatures under 200°C, and if you want to get everything out from your herbs, with less flavour but more potency, you should heat it to the higher temperatures. You don’t have to wait long as it only takes 15 seconds to heat it up!
Pocket-friendly and discreet
Thanks to the compact size of the XMax V3 Pro, it's very pocket-friendly and lightweight making it easy to take with you outside. The discreet look of the unit makes it attractive for those who want a vape that they can quickly hide in their hand or bag when needed.
Not only for herbs
A wax cup is included with the XMax V3 Pro that you can use to vape concentrates such as waxes and oil. Simply add your concentrate to the cup, insert the cup into the vape, and then you are ready to vape. Note that when using concentrates in a vaporizer, you need to use higher temperatures than when vaping herbs.
Innovative mouthpiece
The magnetic mouthpiece is designed with a scraping tool to make cleaning and stirring easier. This heat-resistant plastic mouthpiece can be disassembled and deep cleaned, which helps prevent residue getting stuck.
Great battery
The XMax V3 Pro comes with a high-quality rechargeable, removable 18650 battery that allows you to vape for longer between charges. Each charge provides about 50 minutes of use. If you want to do longer sessions than that, or if you just want to avoid thinking about charging as often, we recommend buying an extra battery so that you can easily replace the discharged one with the charged one and continue.
USB-C charging
Another new thing with the V3 Pro is that it now has a USB-C charging port for ultra-fast charging. The battery is fully charged in about two hours from being completely discharged.
Quality construction
The XMax V3 Pro has an aluminium casing that ensures that it is comfortable to hold and does not get too hot. It also features a ceramic heating chamber for better taste, as well as having precise temperature control to allow you to experiment with different temperatures.
You can also find all relevant information such as set mode/temperature, current temperature, and battery status on the OLED display. The device itself measures only 2.7 × 2.4 × 15.0 cm in size so it will fit easily into all pockets or bags!
Easy to clean
To clean the XMax V3 Pro vaporizer after use just brush off the stainless-steel bowl and screens. If there is any residue left you can remove it with a cotton swab with some alcohol on it.
You can also remove the ceramic and stainless-steel vapour path to fully clean if residue gets stuck in it after using it for a long time.
What's the difference between XMax V2 Pro and V3 Pro?
The XMax V3 Pro is smaller than the original V2 and also has a smaller chamber but it is still enough for one session (0.15 g) so you do not have to think about reloading immediately. Another difference is the convection heating, which shortens the heating time by 80% and means that V3 Pro vape gets more of your herbs.
Warranty
All XMax V3 Pro vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of XMax, are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty on the device and a 6-month warranty on the battery.

This glass bubbler cools down the vapour from the Tinymight, providing a smoother and purer experience. Just fill it with water and you're ready to go. We highly recommend trying a bubbler-enhanced session at least once - you won't want to go back!
How to use the Tinymight bubbler:
Fill the bubbler by running water into the mouthpiece and let it regulate itself. For best results, allow the water filter it to dry completely for at least an hour before use.
Inhale slowly to prevent water from entering your mouth.
Empty the water easily by blowing into the filter.
Clean with alcohol or detergent, then rinse with clear water and let it dry.
Remember, vaporizers have electronic parts that should never come into contact with water.

Who is the Tinymight 2 for?
The Tinymight 2 is a portable convection vaporizer for dry herbs and concentrates. It's designed for vaping anywhere you go and delivers flavourful vapour in just seconds thanks to the powerful convection heater.
If you want to upgrade to a vape that produces cloudy vapour and has a true on-demand mode, you should consider Tinymight 2 as your next vape. It's easy to use and offers not only on-demand mode but also session mode which gives you the flexibility to choose how you want to vape.
100% convection heating
The Tinymight 2 is designed to deliver vapour in less than ten seconds with its custom-built 70W stainless steel heater. The heating system uses 100% convection heating, which evenly heats the material and results in the purest vapour.
The convection heating system in the Tinymight 2 is further enhanced by the addition of a new heat spreader. This feature helps to distribute the heat better, resulting in a more efficient extraction process so you can get the most out of your herbs or concentrates.
A true on-demand vaporizer
While most vaporizers only have one mode of operation, the Tinymight 2 has two: on-demand and session mode. On-demand mode is perfect for those who like to take their time and savour each inhalation, while session mode is ideal for those who prefer to enjoy several inhalations in a row without having to constantly press the button.
On-demand mode turns the heater on to a low temperature that's easy to maintain until you push the button. Once you push it, you typically won't hold the button in for more than five seconds before it vibrates and is ready to go. Enjoy the vapour and when you're done, let go of the button.
Session mode works by keeping the chamber at the set temperature for the duration of the session. Click the button three times and then hold it in until it stops vibrating, then inhale two or three times until the vapour thins. If you plan on taking a longer break between inhalations, just turn it off and restart it when you are ready for more.
Adjustable chamber size
With the Tinymight 2, you can adjust the chamber size to your liking as the cooling chamber slides up and down to change the size of it. The choice is yours whether you want to have it at maximum capacity (0.2 g herb) or have it set at less capacity for smaller doses and microdosing.
Ready to be used with dosing capsules
If you're looking for an easy way to microdose, or simply want to keep the chamber cleaner you should consider using a dosing capsule. These capsules are designed specifically for the Tinymight 2 and allow you to enjoy your vaping sessions without having to worry about the hassle of cleaning.
Simply fill the capsule with your desired material and put it into the chamber. Not only does this make loading the Tinymight 2 quick, but it also means you can prepare another dose for those times you're going somewhere and more than one load would be nice to bring.
One dosing capsule is included for free when you purchase your Tinymight 2 from MagicVaporizers.
Wide temperature range (140°C to 250°C)
The Tinymight 2 has a precision-controlled temperature range between 140°C and 250°C that you set by turning the analogue temperature dial on the bottom of the unit. With its wide temperature range, you'll have plenty of room to experiment and find which temperature works best for you.
Includes a multi-functional tool
The handy multi-functional tool that comes with the Tinymight 2 is right at your fingertips, located on top of the device for easy access during sessions. This tool can be used for stirring the bowl mid-session and it is also long enough to adjust the size of the loading chamber, allowing you to switch between small and large loads with ease.
Fast charging with USB-C
The Tinymight 2 is equipped with a USB-C charging port and is quick-charge capable. It can be charged in under an hour with a rapid charger (not included), so you'll be back to vaping in no time no matter where you are.
When you turn on the unit, it vibrates one to four times depending on the charge of the battery. There is also an indicator light next to the charge port that changes from green to red as the battery drains. This helps you keep track of when you need to charge your device, so you can enjoy your sessions without any interruptions.
Replaceable 18650 battery
As the Tinymight 2 is powered by a replaceable 18650 battery, you won't even have to pause your vaping session if the battery is drained. Simply pop in a fresh battery and you're back to vaping in no time!
In case you want to use another 18650 battery than the included one, please note that it needs to be of high quality with a minimum of 20A current.
Built to last
As expected from a vape manufactured in Finland, the Tinymight 2 is made with exclusively premium materials. Its body is crafted from American walnut wood known for its insulating qualities and smooth structure, which means it has a cool and comfortable grip.
The rest of the device is made with other durable materials like stainless steel, aluminium, and quartz glass, ensuring you'll enjoy its premium performance for years to come.
How to use the Tinymight 2
Here is how you use the Tinymight 2 in on-demand mode:
While holding the unit upside-down, remove the mouthpiece.
Add your material to the opposite end of the mouthpiece. Put the mouthpiece back in while still holding the unit upside-down.
Dial in your desired temp on the bottom of the unit. For lighter vapour, aim for 3-5, but for bigger clouds, go for 7-9.
Give the button a quick triple-click to turn the device on. Wait a few seconds.
The Tinymight 2 is now ready to heat your herbs. Start the increased heating by holding down the button and wait until you feel a vibration.
Inhale from the mouthpiece while keeping the button pressed.
Once you're satisfied, let go of the button but keep inhaling to get all the vapour from the air path.
Enjoy!
When you're done, give the button a quick triple-click to turn it off, or keep repeating from step 5 until your herbs turn light brown and stop producing vapour.
How to set the temperature?
Turn the dial on the bottom of the device to a number that corresponds to the temperature you wish to use. Note that on the highest setting (10) the temperature is different depending on the mode used.

Who is the Crafty Plus Vaporizer for?
With its improved technology and hugely impressive performance, the Crafty+ Vaporizer is equally suitable for both beginners and expert vapers. It’s designed to fit in your pocket, is simple to use and produces flavourful, cool vapour every time. The Crafty Plus is about half the size as its bigger brother, the Mighty, and makes an excellent choice for those looking for a vape that is smaller and more discreet – without compromising on quality.
What is new?
Storz & Bickel released the original Crafty vaporizer in 2014 and it has been updated several times since, but in late 2019 it received a big upgrade and a new name – the Crafty+.
The most significant improvement is the battery which now lasts longer, charges faster, and reduces the heat-up time to only 60 seconds. You are now also able to have three pre-set temperatures instead of just two like before.
It has also decreased in size thanks to a new circuit board and the outer shell has received a facelift making it look even more discreet. Finally, you will also be able to get one more year of warranty, from 2 to 3 years, if you choose to register your Crafty Plus with Storz & Bickel.
In 2021, the next generation of the Crafty+ vaporizer was released. This model features a USB-C socket which reduces charging time by 25 minutes and a ceramic coated filling chamber to make it even more resistant against scratches and damages.
Impressive Battery Life
Crafty+ provides up to a full 60 minutes of continuous vapour production on a full charge, which is surprisingly long considering its small size. A useful vibration mechanism will instantly alert you when the battery is getting low, providing plenty of time to get it charging and continue your session.
Versatile
Unlike most portable vapes The Crafty Plus can vaporize not only herbs but also oils and concentrates. Since you can select any temperature between from 40 to 210 °C you can select the optimal heat level and get dense, flavourful vapour clouds no matter what you choose to vaporize.
Bluetooth App
The app complementing the Crafty+ has been specifically designed to enhance your entire vaping experience. It’s available for both iPhone and Android and allows you to control the temperature, the LED display brightness and also gives you the option of deactivating its vibrating feature should you so wish.
You can also save your favourite temperature settings for future sessions, as the app provides full control without having to touch the device itself. If apps aren’t your thing, you don’t have to worry as use of the app is entirely optional and you can easily control it by simply using the device’s built-in buttons – the choice is entirely yours!
Note: As of 17th November 2019, Apple has restricted vaping apps on App Store, so unless you previously have a downloaded copy of the Storz & Bickel app you need to use a web browser app to control your Crafty Plus from an iPhone.
Strong Performance
Both convection and conduction heating are utilized by the Crafty+ as it features a built-in patented heat exchanger that guarantees a premium performance every time. It’s able to deliver a stable temperature level throughout your entire session meaning you will get dense, flavourful and smooth vapour no matter how quickly you breathe in.
Easy to Clean
Many vaporizers require incredibly complex navigation for disassembling and cleaning purposes, but the Crafty Plus vaporizer has been specifically designed with simplicity in mind. Not only are all components made of the highest possible material quality, but they’re also very easy to take apart without causing damage. This smart design allows you to easily clean this vape thoroughly to ensure maximum hygiene and longevity without wasting time that could be used for vaping instead!
Warranty
All Crafty+ vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Mighty Vape Features
New UK version with 20% better battery (2023.07)
The most powerful portable vape
Easy to use
Pure vapour of the highest quality
Stylish and durable
Precise temperature control (40-210°C)
Who is the Storz & Bickel Mighty for?
The perfect choice for those seeking a top-quality, no frills vaporizer that guarantees premium results every time, the Mighty Vaporizer is a real force to be reckoned with. Super easy to operate and offering premium vapour at all times with its innovative dual heating method, the Mighty Vaporizer is a great choice if you value both quality and performance when vaping.
Whilst a little too large to fit into most pockets, this vaporizer can easily be carried in a bag or purse making it suitable for both on-the-go and at-home use. The only disadvantage of it is the high price compared to other portable vapes, but If you value both quality and performance, you will quickly understand why Mighty is priced relatively high.
Full Temperature Control
Unlike many other vaporizers on the market only offering specific pre-set temperatures for you to choose from, the Mighty Vaporizer provides full control. Allowing you to select any temperature between 40°C and 210°C, the power is solely in your hands. And due to the simplistic plus and minus arrow buttons on its surface, changing this device’s temperature couldn’t be easier – especially useful for beginners.
Impressive Battery Power
Powered by two built-in lithium batteries, the Mighty Vaporizer by Storz & Bickel can provide up to 120 minutes of continuous vaping from just one charging cycle. And when the batteries need to be charged, you can still use this vaporizer with the power adapter provided whilst charging is taking place.
Conduction & Convection Heating
Able to provide continuous high performance to ensure the best quality vapour possible, the Mighty Vaporizer utilizes two impressive heating methods to produce results. Generating heated air to provide constant heat during the evaporation stage for optimum temperature maintenance, its radiation heat guarantees instant quality vapour from the outset.
Never leaving you waiting multiple breaths for top quality, great tasting vapour to be produced, the Mighty Vaporizer guarantees premium performance throughout your entire session.
Automatic Switch Off
Specifically in place to conserve battery life but also maintain maximum safety for yourself and other users, the Mighty vaporizer’s automatic switch off feature is a definite bonus. With the ability to switch itself off after two minutes of activity, if you find yourself slowly dozing off you won’t have to force yourself away to turn off the device.
Better still, the activation of the automatic switch-off function is indication by a brief vibration, meaning you’ll always be notified if the Mighty is deactivating its power. In addition to your safety, this nifty feature also successfully conserves battery life, meaning you can vape for longer without resorting to the power adapter.
Easy to Use
Whilst the Mighty’s impressive performance level makes it a great choice for experienced vaping enthusiasts, its easy operation is also suitable for beginners too. Featuring just two buttons resembling a plus and minus arrow, altering temperature and controlling this device requires no complex mechanisms whatsoever. And with a handy central LED display to provide accurate temperature readings and battery status, you’ll always be in-the-know about how the Mighty Vaporizer is performing.
Warranty
All Mighty Vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)
£89
£119
Features
Induction heating
Great at heating DynaVap vaporizers
Full temperature control (120°C to 425°C)
Borosilicate glass cups
Removable batteries (2 × 2900 mAh)
Safety features
The Wand by Ispire is a portable induction heater for use with concentrates, and in addition to that, it’s also great at heating the tips of DynaVap vaporizers.
What is induction heat?
Induction heat is a highly accurate, controllable, and more predictable heat source than the torches used normally used for this kind of vaping, so you’re going to experience consistency and less waste by eliminating over- or under-heating. Select any temperature you want in 5-degree increments, from 120°C to 425°C.
Wand Glass Adapter for DynaVap vaporizers
If you plan on using the Wand with a DynaVap vaporizer, we recommend getting the Wand Glass Adapter so you can lodge the tip instead of having to swirl it around for even heat. With it, you no longer need to keep an eye on it and can use it hands-free. Just sit back and wait for the “click” of the Captive Cap.
Automatic and manual mode
You can use it in one of two modes, either manual mode or automatic mode. To use it in manual mode, hold the large button down until the cup or your DynaVap reaches your set temperature.
When you first hold the button down the Wand will blink with a red light, then once you put over something metal it will engage the induction heating and pulse a white light while it’s heating up. When it arrives at your set temperature the white light will stay on, meaning you can go ahead and enjoy whatever you're heating.
To use it in automatic mode, double press the large button, and then place it on the induction cup or put your DynaVap in it. One great thing about the automatic mode is that you can take it off and on throughout the cycle and it will just re-engage the heating, so you can sort of feather the heat while in use.
Removable batteries
The Wand is powered by two replaceable 2900 mAh batteries that can be charged with the included USB-C cable, or externally if you have a charger for 18650 batteries.

Straight banger

Duality Torch

Duality Torch
£29
£38
The Duality is a high-quality butane torch lighter. It has a pocket-proof ignition and a single or double flame to choose from depending on your preference. It also features a large tank window that allows you to keep an eye on the fuel level, as well as making it easy to refill it without issue. The flame can be adjusted with the dial at the bottom and the flint ignition can be replaced if it gets worn out.
It ships empty so you need to add butane gas to it before you can use it.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Intended for use with: DynaVap B, DynaVap M, DynaVap M+ (Plus), DynaVap Omni and DynaVap VonG (i): Titanium.

Cyclone Triple Torch

£15
The Vertigo Cyclone Triple Torch is one of the most budget friendly torch lighters you will ever find. It features a large, clear fuel tank so you’ll always know how much fuel remains and it also makes refilling it a lot easier. The wind resistant flame is capable of lighting at 3'500 meters above sea level.
Fill it with filtered butane gas, available at hobby stores and Amazon, before use (not included). We recommend using the brand Colibri but any butane gas that has been filtered at least five times should work well.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Do not clean the Cyclone Triple Torch with alcohol as this will degrade the plastic, resulting in fuel leaks.

DynaVap M Features
Made of stainless steel
Perfect for micro-dosing
On-demand vapour
Unique “clicking” cap
Hybrid heating
Designed and manufactured in USA
Who is the DynaVap M for?
The VapCap M by DynaVap is perfect for anyone looking for an easy-to-use, manually controlled vape with a practically indestructible build. The simple design produces tasty, reliable vapour and allows for stealthy vape sessions where other vaporizers would draw too much attention.
The new things on this version are the revamped chiral airport, an “M’ shaped air intake for easy rocking and adjustments, and updated geometrical indentations on both the tip and body for a slick, stylish finish.
What’s new with the “M” edition?
To ensure maximum flavour, the DynaVap M is still constructed from medical grade stainless steel but it now features the new “Captive Cap” with two small indentations near the end to keep the cap securely in place without affecting the airflow.
Another great feature is that you can adjust the bowl size to half the size for easier micro-dosing. If you are a fan of cooling the vapour you will also appreciate the improved tapered mouthpiece which lets you connect it to a water tool quick and easy.
Manually controlled
The DynaVap M can be heated by practically any external heat source, such as a blowtorch or induction heater. Thanks to this ingenious design it can deliver powerful and tasty hits from tiny amounts of herbs, instantly. The ‘cap’ makes an audible click when it has have reached the minimum temperature and is ready to start the vapour production.
With the DynaVap M’s manual heating, you’re in complete control of the vapour density. Create fast and light vapour, or a thick and heavy vapour, depending on where you heat the cap. Even with the small bowl size, every hit is full of potency and flavour.
Custom bowl size
If you like to match your herb consumption with the occasion you will appreciate that the DynaVap M bowl has two settings - 0.1 grams and 0.05 grams. Perfect for micro-dosing! The stainless-steel bowl is surprisingly effective, even with small amounts of herbs loaded. It's also quick to reload, so you can vape the next bowl quickly after finishing the last one.
It’s capable of vaporizing the entire bowl in 1 to 2 hits but if you don’t finish you can even return to the same bowl later since the DynaVap M does not heat your herb between inhales.
Convenient to bring everywhere
The DynaVap M is 9 centimetres long and weighs only 19 grams, which makes it one of the smallest vape on the market. It’s not just the perfect vaporizer for festivals and camping, it’s also ideal for any traveller as the and the only other things you need are a lighter and some herbs. No other portable dry herb vaporizer offers such instant and powerful vapour at such a reasonable price.
How to use it?
Load the DynaVap M by either adding your herbs to the top or press the tip in the herbs a few times to load it. Use your finger to dust off any excess herbs and put the cap on.
Once your bowl is filled, heat the cap with either a torch or an induction heater until you hear the famous DynaVap “click” that lets you know it’s ready to be used. You can control the airflow by covering the air intake while hitting for thicker vapour, or leave it uncovered for lighter and smoother hits.
Warranty
All DynaVap M vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DynaVap products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is Wolkenkraft FX Mini for?
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini an affordable, ultra-portable convection vaporizer with great performance designed in Germany. It’s small, packs plenty of power and is full of features, but still performs reliably. The FX Mini is the perfect vape for those who want to experience true convection heating, and a solid, low-cost option for anyone serious about vaporizing.
Pure and tasty vapour
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini convection heating system fully extracts the chamber in just a few minutes. As no material touches the heating elements, there is no combustion, instead only the air heats up the material which ensures only pure and flavourful vapour is generated. The air path is sealed from the electronics, with an open airflow for comfortable draws.
Ultra-portable
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini isn’t just small - it’s one of the smallest vapes in our selection, measuring in at 5.1 × 7.6 × 2.5 cm and weighing just 136 grams. It’s easy to hide in the palm of your hand, or bring in a pocket, and is built for durability.
Good battery life
The 1600 mAh battery has a 30 to 40-minute run time, enough for six to eight four-minute sessions, depending on the temperature used. Most vaporizers in this size can only be used for three to four sessions before needing a recharge, but the Wolkenkraft FX Mini can be used for a lot longer than that!
30-second heat-up time
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini is ready to vape in just 25 to 30 seconds, depending on the temperature used and the battery level. Once it’s ready, you can draw in vapour continuously for four minutes, until the session timer expires (extendable by pushing the power button). This means you can have a quick session anywhere, or even use it for one quick hit and then put it back in your pocket.
Easy to use buttons
With no learning curve, the Wolkenkraft FX Mini is the perfect vape to pass around the room, or relax with by yourself. It has three buttons that work like you think they should - turn it on with three clicks of the big button, pick your favourite temperature from 160 to 221°C with the other two buttons, and wait for 25 seconds. It doesn’t get any easier than that!
Bright OLED-display
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini has been equipped with a large, bright and crystal-clear OLED display that shows you the battery charge level, the set temperature, the current temperature and the session timer. A session goes for 240 seconds (4 minutes) after which the FX Mini will shut down automatically. Simply press the power button 5 times again to turn it back on and start another session.
Quality components
The parts of the Wolkenkraft FX Mini coming in contact with your herbs and vapour are carefully selected for maximum purity and flavour. The chamber is made of titanium which makes it easy to clean and can hold up to 0.2 grams of dry herb. To draw in the vapour you use the extendable mouthpiece that is made out of food-grade safe Pyrex glass.
Not only for herbs
If you want to enjoy concentrates such as oil and waxes with the Wolkenkraft FX Mini, all you have to do is use the included concentrate capsule. Start by adding your concentrate to the capsule, insert the capsule in the chamber and then attach the mouthpiece. You are now ready to vape concentrates!
Warranty
All Wolkenkraft FX Mini sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Wolkenkraft products, are authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

These vinyl PAX Caps by Delta 3D Studios are the perfect size to slide over both ends of the PAX Vaporizer to hide odours and act as shock bumpers for light falls. The caps will not interfere with charging the vaporizer, but they can not be used while the PAX vape is running.
Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first. However, the vinyl will stretch with time (you can also use a hair dryer to soften the vinyl before initially putting on). Caps will be much easier to put on/off after a few weeks of use. Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

Who is the PAX 3 for?
If you’re seeking a sleek yet discreet vaporizer that’s both simple to use and incredibly powerful, the PAX 3 is a truly outstanding option. Packing a huge amount of performance in its convenient pocket-sized shape, this vape is hugely versatile and allows you to tailor every single aspect of your session with its useful accompanying app. Stylish and ideal to be taken on-the-go, the PAX 3 is guaranteed to impress.
Fast Heating Time
Offering twice the amount of heating power as its predecessor, the PAX 3 is able to fully heat up in just 15 seconds dependent on the temperature setting selected. Providing efficient and reliable performance almost instantly, you’ll never be left waiting for extended time to begin your session.
Discreet Size & Stylish Finish
Able to fit in the vast majority of pockets and slip discreetly into the palm of your hand, the PAX 3 is perfect for on-the-go use. Better still, its sleek matte finish provides a refreshing alternative to many other vapes on the market, further enhancing its discreet nature and leaving you safe in the knowledge you have one of the most stylish portably vaporizers currently available.
Vaporizes Herbs & Concentrates
When purchasing the complete kit, you’ll receive a handy concentrate insert. Allowing you to effortlessly switch between herbs and concentrates at your leisure, the PAX 3 is able to expertly vaporize both without ever compromising on quality or flavour.
Automatic Sensors
The cutting-edge technology of the PAX 3 utilizes multiple motion sensors to enhance your entire vaporizing experience. Providing an instant vibration when the device has fully heated to your chosen temperature, you’ll never be left aimlessly wondering whether your vape is ready to be used or not.
Better still, the built-in motion sensors only ensure maximum heat is produced when you bring the vape to your lips. Otherwise, it shuts itself off when sensing it’s being set down. Able to save impressive amounts of battery life and only providing heat precisely when you need it, the PAX 3 is hailed for its user-focused nature.
Smartphone App
Allowing you to tailor your vaping session without actually touching the device itself, the PAX 3 accompanying app is a real stand-out feature. Available on both Apple and Android devices, you can use the app to directly set your PAX 3 to a precise temperature, change the LED display colour, and even lock the device to ensure it isn’t switched on by accident. The use of this app is completely optional too, so you can still make the most out of your PAX 3 even if smartphone apps aren’t really your scene – the choice is entirely yours!
Note: As of 17th November 2019, Apple has restricted vaping apps on App Store, so unless you previously have downloaded a copy of the PAX app you won’t be able to control your PAX 3 from an iPhone.
Warranty
All PAX 3 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of PAX Labs products, are authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is the Angus vaporizer for?
The Angus is an innovative vaporizer that features a halogen heating system and glass ball technology to provide a new kind of vaping experience. A halogen light bulb is used for heating air which then passes through glass balls into the chamber where it turns your herbs into vapour before reaching the glass mouthpiece at the top.
Whether you are an experienced user or a beginner, you will find that the Angus is easy to use and capable of producing tasty vapour in just 90 seconds. Its combination of unique heating technology and quality build make it a top choice for anyone looking for a portable premium vaporizer.
Innovative halogen heating system
The halogen heating system used in the Angus is a unique method for heating dry herbs to vaporization temperatures. Unlike other heating systems that use coils or ceramic elements, the Angus vaporizer utilizes a halogen light bulb as the heat source. This bulb, when powered on, emits heat and light, which is then absorbed by the glass balls beneath the chamber of herbs.
When you inhale, the heated air first passes through the glass balls and then the herbs to generate vapour. The combination of the convection heat from the halogen bulb and the radiation heat from the glass balls produces a vapour that is consistent and flavourful.
What sets the Halogen heating system apart from other heating methods is its unique flavour profile. The halogen bulb imparts a subtle flavour that is not as strong or noticeable as it is in other vaporizers and this allows users to taste the full and natural flavour of their herbs.
Easy temperature control
The Angus vape offers a range of temperature control options to help you get the perfect vaporization experience. With five temperature settings ranging from 180°C to 220°C, you can choose the temperature that works best for your herbs.
For those who want higher temperatures (up to 230°C), there is a boost mode that allows you to increase the temperature by 10°C with just the touch of a button. Simply hold the button down and the unit will vibrate once to indicate that the temperature has been boosted. This boost mode is perfect for when you want to get your herbs fully extracted.
Design and durability
The Angus vaporizer boasts a stunning walnut body that not only adds to its aesthetic appeal but also offers a comfortable grip. The body is crafted to last and its sturdy construction ensures that it can withstand daily use.
To further enhance its durability, the Angus has undergone rigorous drop testing and has proven to be able to survive multiple drops from a height of 1.5 meters with only replaceable parts, such as the glass mouthpiece, needing to be replaced.
Chamber size and microdosing
Even though the Angus vaporizer is compact it still has a spacious stainless steel herb chamber with a 0.25 g capacity that easily can be kept clean with the included tweezer.
With fully charged batteries, you can expect to vaporize approximately 2 g of your favourite herbs during 8 sessions if you fill the chamber every time. If you want to make reloading even quicker, use the included dosing capsules (2) to prepare ahead of time.
For those who prefer to microdose with their herbs, the Angus provides plenty of convection heating to do so without the need for any temperature adjustments. Simply put less herbs in the chamber and use it as normal for a lower dose experience.
Improved cooling system
The Angus vaporizer has been upgraded with a new cooling system, now featuring a stainless steel screen and a centrepiece made of high-quality stainless steel.
The cooling unit has also been improved with PEEK material, offering better durability and protection against melting. This updated design addresses the issues of lower-quality PPSU material used in the previous cooling unit, ensuring safer vaping.
Quick heat-up time
With an approximate 90-second initial pre-heat time, it is recommended to turn on the vaporizer and select your desired temperature before loading it to minimise wait times. Subsequent sessions will heat up faster due to the retained heat.
Powered by 18650 batteries
The Angus vaporizer is powered by two 18650 batteries. Depending on your usage and temperature setting, you can expect to get anywhere from 7-10 full sessions before the batteries need to be recharged. The exact number of sessions will depend on factors such as the frequency of use and the amount of heat retained between sessions.
Two powerful 18650 batteries (2800 mAh) from Molicel are included for free when you purchase your Angus from MagicVaporizers.
Adjustable airflow
With the Angus vaporizer, users can customize the airflow to their preferences. To adjust it, simply rotate the metal screen dial located in the mouthpiece.
5-minute sessions
Designed for use as a session vape, the Angus features a 5-minute shut-off timer. If you are short on time you can still get a great session with just a few large inhales on the max settings. Whether you prefer long sessions or going all in, the Angus delivers satisfying results.
Carry case included
The Angus also comes with a sleek and stylish carry case that makes it incredibly easy to transport your vaporizer wherever you go. The case is made of high-quality materials and provides ample protection against any potential damage. This carry case not only adds an extra level of convenience but also makes it easy to keep your vaporizer in a safe and secure place.
Can be upgraded
Want even cooler vapour? The Angus vaporizer has a water pipe adapter available for add-on purchase which can take your vaping experience to the next level. The adapter allows you to connect it to your favourite water tool (the adapter fits 18 mm and 14 mm female connections) to let the vapour be cooled down as it passes through water which makes it smoother and more comfortable to inhale.
How to use the Angus vaporizer
Even without a display, the Angus is still very easy to use:
Turn the Angus on by clicking the button three times.
Either fill the herb chamber before turning it on or fill it with your herb of choice now.
Wait for approximately 90 seconds for the Angus to heat up. The haptic feedback will vibrate when the set temperature is reached.
Enjoy the delicious vapour!
...or change the temperature by pressing the button to cycle through the five temperature settings: 180, 190, 200, 210, and 220°C.
Once the desired temperature is reached you can hold down the button for a 10°C degree temperature boost. The Angus will vibrate to indicate the temperature has been boosted.
Once you’re done, either click the button three times again or wait for the session timer to run out (5 minutes).
Warranty
All Angus vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of YLL Vape products, are authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Storz & Bickel Vaporizers
Invest in a Storz & Bickel vaporizer if you want a dependable vape that produces the highest vapour quality for years to come. The popular Volcano Classic was released in 2001 and is still considered by many to be one of the greatest desktop vaporizers on the market today, provided you can afford it.If you want to get up and away from the couch, the Mighty is one of our favourite portable vaporizers, thanks to its long battery life and smooth, tasty vapour. A Storz & Bickel vape may cost a bit more, but it is definitely worth the extra money.

What makes Storz and Bickel better?
Storz & Bickel vaporizers have a well-deserved reputation for being among the best in the business. They are always innovating with vapes that will set the standard for the rest of the industry for years to come. It's hard to believe that Storz and Bickel only have developed a few vaporizers since their start in 1996, but their designs are so durable and innovative that others have copied them even decades later. Despite their premium price, these vaporizers are well worth the money.
The Volcano Experience
You can tell just by looking at a Volcano vaporizer that you are going to have an amazing experience. Instead of taking the conventional route, they gave their product a rugged, heavy-duty design that screams "power". As soon as you use the device, you will understand why it is designed as it is. Your hits will be thick and potent with a smoothness that you haven't tasted before.
It is available in two models, The Volcano Classic and The Volcano Hybrid. Both of them are fantastic desktop models that function well as centrepieces on their own. Set the Volcano on the coffee table, get out one of the Volcano balloons, fill the balloon with vapour, and pass the balloon around for effortless vapour inhalations.
The Volcano Classic, the first vaporizer from Storz & Bickel, is known for its consistency, reliability, and durability. Many vapour enthusiasts have been using it for almost two decades to blow up delicious bags of vapour and for some, this is the only vaporizer they ever purchase.
Don't get too nostalgic though, a new and improved version is now available: the Volcano Hybrid. Although the new model resembles the previous model, the controls and LED touch display have been improved for an improved aesthetic. Additionally, the Volcano Hybrid is much faster to heat up. You and your fellow vapers will only need to wait 1–2 minutes for the balloon to fill with vapour. Storz & Bickel also listened to user feedback and added the capability of inhaling vapour directly through the new tube system.
Volcano Hybrid's biggest improvement is its integration with smartphones. With the S&B Web app, users can control the device and create their own custom sessions to be re-used over and over. What more could you ever need from a stationary vaporizer?
Plenty of Power
Storz & Bickel's first "portable" vaporizer was the Plenty vaporizer. Even though it may be called portable, it isn't pocket-sized due to being 30 cm high. Although, it is certainly a great addition to your living room sessions, as it produces super thick and flavourful vapour from a unit that can easily be passed around in a circle of friends.
Including the temperature display, this vaporizer is completely mechanical, increasing its durability. The Plenty might seem intimidating at first, but with the easy-to-understand quick-start guide, you will be able to begin vaping just a few minutes after receiving it.
The Mighty Portable Vaporizer
Portable and powerful, the Mighty vaporizer combines the best of both worlds. With a compact design, but larger size than the Crafty+, this vape has two rechargeable batteries, a heating chamber, and a coolant unit. Featuring a long battery runtime, a mouthpiece that keeps vapour cool, and simple controls, it extracts all herbs fully with ease.
Although the outer parts are made mostly of plastic, its build quality remains unquestioned. Most of the device's surface is covered with a grid pattern, which enhances cooling. The device's heating chamber is separated from the batteries, which adds to the effectiveness of this separation.
Storz & Bickel's latest innovation - The Mighty+
The new Mighty+ vaporizer is a must-have for those who want the best portable vaporizer. With an optimized design and some incredible features, this vape will bring you joy for years.
The most exciting feature is the USB-C port, which means you can charge your vape anywhere and 25 minutes faster than the original Mighty! Storz & Bickel also improved the heat-up time by 60 seconds and made changing the temperature easier with the new Boost-mode, so that you can quickly increase the temperature in the middle of a session.
The Ultra-Portable Crafty+
The Crafty+ vaporizer is the smallest vaporizer from Storz & Bickel and features an ergonomic body that offers a good grip and comfortable feel. While other vaporizers choose portability over power, the Crafty+ has both. Combining conduction and convection, the patented hybrid heating system produces silky smooth vapour every time.
You can also control the Crafty+ using S&B's Web app. In addition to enabling users to turn their device on, it can also provide them with a way to locate their lost devices as well as extend their shut-off time up to 5 minutes. It is also possible to select temperatures using 1°C increments or to boost the temperature by 15°C using the application.
Overall, the Crafty+ is an innovative, high-tech portable vape with a USB-C port, featuring 30% faster heating than the previous model and improved electronics. With a pocket-sized design, this vape combines sophistication and power.

I have a problem with my device and require warranty assistance
Go to our warranty page to submit the warranty form. After submission, a MagicVaporizers representative will contact you shortly.
I don’t see visible vapour from my vaporizer
Visible vapour is not guaranteed when using a vaporizer. It depends on many factors such as heating method, the material being vaped, airflow, the vaping temperature, humidity, and more.
If you are used to vaping e-juices and expect the same amount of visible vapour you should lower your expectations for vaporizing herbs/waxes/oils as e-juice contains vegetable glycerin which is a thick liquid that produces the visible vapour.
We always recommend watching YouTube reviews of the vapes you’re interested in to get an accurate visualization of the vapour visibility and thickness you can expect. However, there are a few ways you can increase the thickness of the vapour if that’s your priority:
If you’re using herbs, grind them fine and pack them tight (but not too tight so that air can still pass through).
If it’s a convection vape you want to make sure to cover the whole surface area of the oven.
Raise the temperature. You will sacrifice flavour on temperatures over 180°C, but the higher temperature the more visible vapour you will see.
Inhale deeply and breathe out quickly.
As an example, one of the best stationary vaporizers – the Volcano Classic – which concentrates all the vapour to a balloon, can produce balloons with vapour you can’t even see at 180°C, but it can also produce balloons with vapour as white as milk at the higher temperatures (215°C+).
We understand some customers prefer big clouds as it looks cooler but don't let your eyes decide if the vaporizer is working well, instead go after what you feel. If your material looks brown after being vaped, it usually means the vaporizer is working well.
Remember the vaporizers we sell are meant to extract the active ingredients of your material as efficiently as possible with the best possible flavours, not just to produce the thickest vapour possible.
I have a question before I place an order
How long does it take to ship to my order?
We ship all packages on the same, or next, business day depending on the time of the order, and we ship all our orders with DPD Next Day Delivery, so it should arrive at your address the following business day. You will always receive a tracking link where you can follow your order and get all the delivery details. Be aware that orders shipping to Scotland and Northern Ireland usually take one more business day to arrive.
Do I need to pay customs duty on my order?
No, our warehouse is located in Portsmouth, United Kingdom and thus there are no custom duties to pay.
How does Brexit affect my order?
As our warehouse is located in Portsmouth and our orders are shipped locally everything is already taken care of. Your order will not cost anything extra than what you see in the checkout or be delayed because of Brexit.
Do you sell to people located outside the United Kingdom?
No. The products available in this shop are located in our Portsmouth warehouse and will only ship to customers inside the United Kingdom. If you want to place an order to another country in Europe, go to MagicVaporizers.com.
I tried to pay by card, but your system refused my payment
This most likely happened because your card doesn’t have 3D secure enabled. 3D Secure is a system adopted by the credit card issuers that stops fraudulent transactions by requiring another verification method (usually by phone) instead of just the card information.
You need to enable 3D Secure to make safe purchases online. To enable 3D Secure for your card you should contact your bank and ask them to enable it. This protection is for your safety when you make purchases online and to prevent fraudulent use of your card. Once enabled, please place a new order and complete the payment.
If you still experience problems with your payment, or if you are facing another issue, please contact us using the form below.
Do you have any physical stores in UK?
No, we only sell online. This way we can keep the costs down and the prices lower.
Can I have a discount code?
Unfortunately, no. We take great pride in our low prices and our policy is not to give out discount codes unless they are available to everyone.
Do you ship the packages discreetly?
Yes. We ship our packages in plain brown boxes without any references to MagicVaporizers on them. Our sender name is “Anything Worldwide” which ensures no one will be suspicious of the contents inside.
Do you offer cash on delivery, or can I pick up my order in person?
Since we strive to offer the best prices, we only sell online. All orders must be fully paid before they leave our warehouse. It's not possible to visit our warehouse to pick up your order in person. We will deliver it to your door and a tracking number is always provided so you can follow its way and make any necessary changes concerning the delivery.
I have problems placing an order
Please contact us using the form below. Try to describe your problem as detailed as possible, including any error messages.

How long is the delivery time?

Why do I need a vaporizer?
You might already be aware that using a vaporizer to consume herbs is healthier than to burn them, but that is just one of many benefits. Not only will your body thank you, but as vaporizing is an extremely effective method you will end up with more money for herbs too. Vapour also smells a lot less, doesn’t stick to furniture or wallpaper and will dissipate in a lot shorter time than smoke, meaning you will have more opportunities for your herb consumption.
Get a vaporizer with adjustable temperature and you will discover that different temperatures produce different effects and flavours. With a vaporizer you can always get consistent results and decide if you want to go for full flavours or maximum extraction. Once you have decided to step in to the world of vaporizers, get ready for a wide range of choices and options to consider.
Finding the right vaporizer for you
Before we dive into the specifics of vaporizers, let's start off with covering the basics. The three most common types of vaporizers are e-cigs, dry herb vaporizer and concentrate vaporizers. If you are looking for an e-cig (for e-juices), try another Google search as you won’t find those in our shop. If you are interested in getting a dry herb, or concentrate vaporizer, well done, you have come to the right place.
Instead of burning your herbs to smoke and ashes, dry herb vaporizers gently extract the active ingredients from your herbs, resulting in a strong and aromatic vapour. A vaporizer will never heat your herbs to their burning point, but the higher the temperature, the stronger the effects are.
Think through where you plan to use your vaporizer the most. If you plan on using it at home only, we recommend you to get a stationary vaporizer. These vaporizers connect to an electrical outlet and are for that reason the most powerful ones. There are many types, some useable by a whip, some useable by balloons and even some with both (the Volcano Hybrid and the Arizer Extreme Q).
If you don’t want to be bound to an electrical outlet for your vaporizer sessions you are looking for a portable vaporizer. The dry herb vaporizers we have in our selection are some of the best available on the market and there are good options for every price point. Consider the vaporizer’s heating type, heat-up time, battery life and size before you make your choice. If you want the best however, you can’t go wrong with the Mighty+ vaporizer.

What is a vaporizer?
A vaporizer is a device that can heat up materials like herbs and concentrates to a high enough temperature that they release their active ingredients into vapour that is then inhaled. The material never gets hot enough to combust, meaning they produce no smoke or carcinogens.
How does a vaporizer work?
Vaporizers use conduction heating, convection heating or both (hybrid). Conduction heating means the material is heated through direct contact with a hot surface, and convection heating means the material is heated by hot air passing through it. If you want full flavours go for convection and if you want maximum extraction go for conduction.
How to use a vaporizer?
The process is very easy and normally goes like this:
Grind your herbs to small pieces (preferably with a grinder).
Fill the heating chamber of your vaporizer with your ground herbs.
Start your vaporizer and select your desired temperature.
Wait for your vaporizer to heat up, usually less than 30 seconds.
Inhale the delicious vapour your vaporizer now produces!
How much does a vaporizer cost?
They can cost anywhere from £40 up to £500 depending on the features such as heat-up time, temperature control, battery capacity, heating type, size, warranty time, what they can vaporize and a lot more.
What vaporizer should I buy?
First you have to determine how you would use it. Will you only use it at home? Get a stationary vaporizer like the Volcano Hybrid. Want to be able to bring it with you? Get a portable vape like the Mighty vape.
Which is the best vaporizer?
Our top 5 favourites right now are:
Mighty+ vaporizer – The most powerful portable vaporizer

How to clean a vaporizer?
You should regularly clean out the chamber and mouthpiece with a brush, but if you want to do a deep clean of your vaporizer you should soak the detachable parts in isopropyl alcohol. Leave them submerged in alcohol overnight and rinse them with warm water the day after.

Make charging easier and extend the longevity of your vaporizer by using this Magnetic USB-C Adapter.

This Magnetic USB-C Adapter is compatible with all types of vaporizers and can be used with any USB-C cable. It has a 120W / 5A capacity meaning that it's strong enough to even charge laptops.

Who is the Mighty+ (Plus) for?
The Storz and Bickel Mighty+ is a dry herb vaporizer that delivers the same great vapour quality as the original Mighty, but with USB-C charging and a faster heat-up time.
It's still straightforward and easy to use, with a just three buttons to control the heating, which means it's a great vape both for beginners who will appreciate its simplicity and for expert users that can take full advantage of its incredible heating power and durability.
Improved design
The new design of the Mighty+ makes it perfect for everyday use. The filling chamber now has a ceramic coating which means that your herbs will taste even better. Another highly requested feature are the new fins that are discretely placed on the bottom to allow it to stand upright for when it’s not being used or connected to a water tool.
The ultimate way to heat your herbs or concentrate
The Mighty+'s patented heating technology with conduction and convection heating combined heats up herb or concentrate efficiently and evenly without having to be stirred. Unlike the original, it also features an optimized heater that warms-up in 60 seconds or less.
Experiment with temperatures
Because you have the option to select any temperature between 40°C and 210°C, you can fully customize your vaping experience with the Mighty+ vaporizer!
Storz & Bickel also added an additional temperature changing option. Triple-clicking the On-Off button will automatically increase the current temperature by 15°C and allows you to switch between temperatures much more quickly than before.
Even faster charging
The new USB-C port with the “Supercharge” function on The Mighty+ will allow you to charge the two 3300 mAh batteries up to 80% in just 40 minutes. You can now fast-charge your device anywhere, allowing you more time vaping instead of charging.
It also features pass-through charging which means you can use the Mighty+ while it's charging!
Quality certified
The Mighty+ is the first ever dry herb vaporizer to gain UL certification. Sleep easy in the knowledge that a third party safety certification company has inspected all of its electrical, battery and heating systems!
Warranty
All Mighty+ vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty + 1 extra year after registration, restricted to normal use.

Tinymight - Bubbler

This glass bubbler cools down the vapour from the Tinymight, providing a smoother and purer experience. Just fill it with water and you're ready to go. We highly recommend trying a bubbler-enhanced session at least once - you won't want to go back!
How to use the Tinymight bubbler:
Fill the bubbler by running water into the mouthpiece and let it regulate itself. For best results, allow the water filter it to dry completely for at least an hour before use.
Inhale slowly to prevent water from entering your mouth.
Empty the water easily by blowing into the filter.
Clean with alcohol or detergent, then rinse with clear water and let it dry.
Remember, vaporizers have electronic parts that should never come into contact with water.
Intended for use with: Tinymight 2.
This product includes only the glass bubbler. A vaporizer is not included.

Who is the Tinymight 2 for?
The Tinymight 2 is a portable convection vaporizer for dry herbs and concentrates. It's designed for vaping anywhere you go and delivers flavourful vapour in just seconds thanks to the powerful convection heater.
If you want to upgrade to a vape that produces cloudy vapour and has a true on-demand mode, you should consider Tinymight 2 as your next vape. It's easy to use and offers not only on-demand mode but also session mode which gives you the flexibility to choose how you want to vape.
100% convection heating
The Tinymight 2 is designed to deliver vapour in less than ten seconds with its custom-built 70W stainless steel heater. The heating system uses 100% convection heating, which evenly heats the material and results in the purest vapour.
The convection heating system in the Tinymight 2 is further enhanced by the addition of a new heat spreader. This feature helps to distribute the heat better, resulting in a more efficient extraction process so you can get the most out of your herbs or concentrates.
A true on-demand vaporizer
While most vaporizers only have one mode of operation, the Tinymight 2 has two: on-demand and session mode. On-demand mode is perfect for those who like to take their time and savour each inhalation, while session mode is ideal for those who prefer to enjoy several inhalations in a row without having to constantly press the button.
On-demand mode turns the heater on to a low temperature that's easy to maintain until you push the button. Once you push it, you typically won't hold the button in for more than five seconds before it vibrates and is ready to go. Enjoy the vapour and when you're done, let go of the button.
Session mode works by keeping the chamber at the set temperature for the duration of the session. Click the button three times and then hold it in until it stops vibrating, then inhale two or three times until the vapour thins. If you plan on taking a longer break between inhalations, just turn it off and restart it when you are ready for more.
Adjustable chamber size
With the Tinymight 2, you can adjust the chamber size to your liking as the cooling chamber slides up and down to change the size of it. The choice is yours whether you want to have it at maximum capacity (0.2 g herb) or have it set at less capacity for smaller doses and microdosing.
Ready to be used with dosing capsules
If you're looking for an easy way to microdose, or simply want to keep the chamber cleaner you should consider using a dosing capsule. These capsules are designed specifically for the Tinymight 2 and allow you to enjoy your vaping sessions without having to worry about the hassle of cleaning.
Simply fill the capsule with your desired material and put it into the chamber. Not only does this make loading the Tinymight 2 quick, but it also means you can prepare another dose for those times you're going somewhere and more than one load would be nice to bring.
One dosing capsule is included for free when you purchase your Tinymight 2 from MagicVaporizers.
Wide temperature range (140°C to 250°C)
The Tinymight 2 has a precision-controlled temperature range between 140°C and 250°C that you set by turning the analogue temperature dial on the bottom of the unit. With its wide temperature range, you'll have plenty of room to experiment and find which temperature works best for you.
Includes a multi-functional tool
The handy multi-functional tool that comes with the Tinymight 2 is right at your fingertips, located on top of the device for easy access during sessions. This tool can be used for stirring the bowl mid-session and it is also long enough to adjust the size of the loading chamber, allowing you to switch between small and large loads with ease.
Fast charging with USB-C
The Tinymight 2 is equipped with a USB-C charging port and is quick-charge capable. It can be charged in under an hour with a rapid charger (not included), so you'll be back to vaping in no time no matter where you are.
When you turn on the unit, it vibrates one to four times depending on the charge of the battery. There is also an indicator light next to the charge port that changes from green to red as the battery drains. This helps you keep track of when you need to charge your device, so you can enjoy your sessions without any interruptions.
Replaceable 18650 battery
As the Tinymight 2 is powered by a replaceable 18650 battery, you won't even have to pause your vaping session if the battery is drained. Simply pop in a fresh battery and you're back to vaping in no time!
In case you want to use another 18650 battery than the included one, please note that it needs to be of high quality with a minimum of 20A current.
Built to last
As expected from a vape manufactured in Finland, the Tinymight 2 is made with exclusively premium materials. Its body is crafted from American walnut wood known for its insulating qualities and smooth structure, which means it has a cool and comfortable grip.
The rest of the device is made with other durable materials like stainless steel, aluminium, and quartz glass, ensuring you'll enjoy its premium performance for years to come.
How to use the Tinymight 2
Here is how you use the Tinymight 2 in on-demand mode:
While holding the unit upside-down, remove the mouthpiece.
Add your material to the opposite end of the mouthpiece. Put the mouthpiece back in while still holding the unit upside-down.
Dial in your desired temp on the bottom of the unit. For lighter vapour, aim for 3-5, but for bigger clouds, go for 7-9.
Give the button a quick triple-click to turn the device on. Wait a few seconds.
The Tinymight 2 is now ready to heat your herbs. Start the increased heating by holding down the button and wait until you feel a vibration.
Inhale from the mouthpiece while keeping the button pressed.
Once you're satisfied, let go of the button but keep inhaling to get all the vapour from the air path.
Enjoy!
When you're done, give the button a quick triple-click to turn it off, or keep repeating from step 5 until your herbs turn light brown and stop producing vapour.
How to set the temperature?
Turn the dial on the bottom of the device to a number that corresponds to the temperature you wish to use. Note that on the highest setting (10) the temperature is different depending on the mode used.

PAX - Caps (2-pack)

These vinyl PAX Caps by Delta 3D Studios are the perfect size to slide over both ends of the PAX Vaporizer to hide odours and act as shock bumpers for light falls. The caps will not interfere with charging the vaporizer, but they can not be used while the PAX vape is running.
Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first. However, the vinyl will stretch with time (you can also use a hair dryer to soften the vinyl before initially putting on). Caps will be much easier to put on/off after a few weeks of use. Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

Who is the PAX 3 for?
If you’re seeking a sleek yet discreet vaporizer that’s both simple to use and incredibly powerful, the PAX 3 is a truly outstanding option. Packing a huge amount of performance in its convenient pocket-sized shape, this vape is hugely versatile and allows you to tailor every single aspect of your session with its useful accompanying app. Stylish and ideal to be taken on-the-go, the PAX 3 is guaranteed to impress.
Fast Heating Time
Offering twice the amount of heating power as its predecessor, the PAX 3 is able to fully heat up in just 15 seconds dependent on the temperature setting selected. Providing efficient and reliable performance almost instantly, you’ll never be left waiting for extended time to begin your session.
Discreet Size & Stylish Finish
Able to fit in the vast majority of pockets and slip discreetly into the palm of your hand, the PAX 3 is perfect for on-the-go use. Better still, its sleek matte finish provides a refreshing alternative to many other vapes on the market, further enhancing its discreet nature and leaving you safe in the knowledge you have one of the most stylish portably vaporizers currently available.
Vaporizes Herbs & Concentrates
When purchasing the complete kit, you’ll receive a handy concentrate insert. Allowing you to effortlessly switch between herbs and concentrates at your leisure, the PAX 3 is able to expertly vaporize both without ever compromising on quality or flavour.
Automatic Sensors
The cutting-edge technology of the PAX 3 utilizes multiple motion sensors to enhance your entire vaporizing experience. Providing an instant vibration when the device has fully heated to your chosen temperature, you’ll never be left aimlessly wondering whether your vape is ready to be used or not.
Better still, the built-in motion sensors only ensure maximum heat is produced when you bring the vape to your lips. Otherwise, it shuts itself off when sensing it’s being set down. Able to save impressive amounts of battery life and only providing heat precisely when you need it, the PAX 3 is hailed for its user-focused nature.
Smartphone App
Allowing you to tailor your vaping session without actually touching the device itself, the PAX 3 accompanying app is a real stand-out feature. Available on both Apple and Android devices, you can use the app to directly set your PAX 3 to a precise temperature, change the LED display colour, and even lock the device to ensure it isn’t switched on by accident. The use of this app is completely optional too, so you can still make the most out of your PAX 3 even if smartphone apps aren’t really your scene – the choice is entirely yours!
Note: As of 17th November 2019, Apple has restricted vaping apps on App Store, so unless you previously have downloaded a copy of the PAX app you won’t be able to control your PAX 3 from an iPhone.
Warranty
All PAX 3 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of PAX Labs products, are authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

These vinyl PAX Caps by Delta 3D Studios are the perfect size to slide over both ends of the PAX Vaporizer to hide odours and act as shock bumpers for light falls. The caps will not interfere with charging the vaporizer, but they can not be used while the PAX vape is running.
Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first. However, the vinyl will stretch with time (you can also use a hair dryer to soften the vinyl before initially putting on). Caps will be much easier to put on/off after a few weeks of use. Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

Who is the PAX 3 for?
If you’re seeking a sleek yet discreet vaporizer that’s both simple to use and incredibly powerful, the PAX 3 is a truly outstanding option. Packing a huge amount of performance in its convenient pocket-sized shape, this vape is hugely versatile and allows you to tailor every single aspect of your session with its useful accompanying app. Stylish and ideal to be taken on-the-go, the PAX 3 is guaranteed to impress.
Fast Heating Time
Offering twice the amount of heating power as its predecessor, the PAX 3 is able to fully heat up in just 15 seconds dependent on the temperature setting selected. Providing efficient and reliable performance almost instantly, you’ll never be left waiting for extended time to begin your session.
Discreet Size & Stylish Finish
Able to fit in the vast majority of pockets and slip discreetly into the palm of your hand, the PAX 3 is perfect for on-the-go use. Better still, its sleek matte finish provides a refreshing alternative to many other vapes on the market, further enhancing its discreet nature and leaving you safe in the knowledge you have one of the most stylish portably vaporizers currently available.
Vaporizes Herbs & Concentrates
When purchasing the complete kit, you’ll receive a handy concentrate insert. Allowing you to effortlessly switch between herbs and concentrates at your leisure, the PAX 3 is able to expertly vaporize both without ever compromising on quality or flavour.
Automatic Sensors
The cutting-edge technology of the PAX 3 utilizes multiple motion sensors to enhance your entire vaporizing experience. Providing an instant vibration when the device has fully heated to your chosen temperature, you’ll never be left aimlessly wondering whether your vape is ready to be used or not.
Better still, the built-in motion sensors only ensure maximum heat is produced when you bring the vape to your lips. Otherwise, it shuts itself off when sensing it’s being set down. Able to save impressive amounts of battery life and only providing heat precisely when you need it, the PAX 3 is hailed for its user-focused nature.
Smartphone App
Allowing you to tailor your vaping session without actually touching the device itself, the PAX 3 accompanying app is a real stand-out feature. Available on both Apple and Android devices, you can use the app to directly set your PAX 3 to a precise temperature, change the LED display colour, and even lock the device to ensure it isn’t switched on by accident. The use of this app is completely optional too, so you can still make the most out of your PAX 3 even if smartphone apps aren’t really your scene – the choice is entirely yours!
Note: As of 17th November 2019, Apple has restricted vaping apps on App Store, so unless you previously have downloaded a copy of the PAX app you won’t be able to control your PAX 3 from an iPhone.
Warranty
All PAX 3 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of PAX Labs products, are authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is the PAX 3 for?
If you’re seeking a sleek yet discreet vaporizer that’s both simple to use and incredibly powerful, the PAX 3 is a truly outstanding option. Packing a huge amount of performance in its convenient pocket-sized shape, this vape is hugely versatile and allows you to tailor every single aspect of your session with its useful accompanying app. Stylish and ideal to be taken on-the-go, the PAX 3 is guaranteed to impress.
Fast Heating Time
Offering twice the amount of heating power as its predecessor, the PAX 3 is able to fully heat up in just 15 seconds dependent on the temperature setting selected. Providing efficient and reliable performance almost instantly, you’ll never be left waiting for extended time to begin your session.
Discreet Size & Stylish Finish
Able to fit in the vast majority of pockets and slip discreetly into the palm of your hand, the PAX 3 is perfect for on-the-go use. Better still, its sleek matte finish provides a refreshing alternative to many other vapes on the market, further enhancing its discreet nature and leaving you safe in the knowledge you have one of the most stylish portably vaporizers currently available.
Vaporizes Herbs & Concentrates
When purchasing the complete kit, you’ll receive a handy concentrate insert. Allowing you to effortlessly switch between herbs and concentrates at your leisure, the PAX 3 is able to expertly vaporize both without ever compromising on quality or flavour.
Automatic Sensors
The cutting-edge technology of the PAX 3 utilizes multiple motion sensors to enhance your entire vaporizing experience. Providing an instant vibration when the device has fully heated to your chosen temperature, you’ll never be left aimlessly wondering whether your vape is ready to be used or not.
Better still, the built-in motion sensors only ensure maximum heat is produced when you bring the vape to your lips. Otherwise, it shuts itself off when sensing it’s being set down. Able to save impressive amounts of battery life and only providing heat precisely when you need it, the PAX 3 is hailed for its user-focused nature.
Smartphone App
Allowing you to tailor your vaping session without actually touching the device itself, the PAX 3 accompanying app is a real stand-out feature. Available on both Apple and Android devices, you can use the app to directly set your PAX 3 to a precise temperature, change the LED display colour, and even lock the device to ensure it isn’t switched on by accident. The use of this app is completely optional too, so you can still make the most out of your PAX 3 even if smartphone apps aren’t really your scene – the choice is entirely yours!
Note: As of 17th November 2019, Apple has restricted vaping apps on App Store, so unless you previously have downloaded a copy of the PAX app you won’t be able to control your PAX 3 from an iPhone.
Warranty
All PAX 3 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of PAX Labs products, are authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

These vinyl PAX Caps by Delta 3D Studios are the perfect size to slide over both ends of the PAX Vaporizer to hide odours and act as shock bumpers for light falls. The caps will not interfere with charging the vaporizer, but they can not be used while the PAX vape is running.
Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first. However, the vinyl will stretch with time (you can also use a hair dryer to soften the vinyl before initially putting on). Caps will be much easier to put on/off after a few weeks of use. Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

Who is the PAX 3 for?
If you’re seeking a sleek yet discreet vaporizer that’s both simple to use and incredibly powerful, the PAX 3 is a truly outstanding option. Packing a huge amount of performance in its convenient pocket-sized shape, this vape is hugely versatile and allows you to tailor every single aspect of your session with its useful accompanying app. Stylish and ideal to be taken on-the-go, the PAX 3 is guaranteed to impress.
Fast Heating Time
Offering twice the amount of heating power as its predecessor, the PAX 3 is able to fully heat up in just 15 seconds dependent on the temperature setting selected. Providing efficient and reliable performance almost instantly, you’ll never be left waiting for extended time to begin your session.
Discreet Size & Stylish Finish
Able to fit in the vast majority of pockets and slip discreetly into the palm of your hand, the PAX 3 is perfect for on-the-go use. Better still, its sleek matte finish provides a refreshing alternative to many other vapes on the market, further enhancing its discreet nature and leaving you safe in the knowledge you have one of the most stylish portably vaporizers currently available.
Vaporizes Herbs & Concentrates
When purchasing the complete kit, you’ll receive a handy concentrate insert. Allowing you to effortlessly switch between herbs and concentrates at your leisure, the PAX 3 is able to expertly vaporize both without ever compromising on quality or flavour.
Automatic Sensors
The cutting-edge technology of the PAX 3 utilizes multiple motion sensors to enhance your entire vaporizing experience. Providing an instant vibration when the device has fully heated to your chosen temperature, you’ll never be left aimlessly wondering whether your vape is ready to be used or not.
Better still, the built-in motion sensors only ensure maximum heat is produced when you bring the vape to your lips. Otherwise, it shuts itself off when sensing it’s being set down. Able to save impressive amounts of battery life and only providing heat precisely when you need it, the PAX 3 is hailed for its user-focused nature.
Smartphone App
Allowing you to tailor your vaping session without actually touching the device itself, the PAX 3 accompanying app is a real stand-out feature. Available on both Apple and Android devices, you can use the app to directly set your PAX 3 to a precise temperature, change the LED display colour, and even lock the device to ensure it isn’t switched on by accident. The use of this app is completely optional too, so you can still make the most out of your PAX 3 even if smartphone apps aren’t really your scene – the choice is entirely yours!
Note: As of 17th November 2019, Apple has restricted vaping apps on App Store, so unless you previously have downloaded a copy of the PAX app you won’t be able to control your PAX 3 from an iPhone.
Warranty
All PAX 3 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of PAX Labs products, are authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

These vinyl PAX Caps by Delta 3D Studios are the perfect size to slide over both ends of the PAX Vaporizer to hide odours and act as shock bumpers for light falls. The caps will not interfere with charging the vaporizer, but they can not be used while the PAX vape is running.
Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first. However, the vinyl will stretch with time (you can also use a hair dryer to soften the vinyl before initially putting on). Caps will be much easier to put on/off after a few weeks of use. Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

Who is the PAX 3 for?
If you’re seeking a sleek yet discreet vaporizer that’s both simple to use and incredibly powerful, the PAX 3 is a truly outstanding option. Packing a huge amount of performance in its convenient pocket-sized shape, this vape is hugely versatile and allows you to tailor every single aspect of your session with its useful accompanying app. Stylish and ideal to be taken on-the-go, the PAX 3 is guaranteed to impress.
Fast Heating Time
Offering twice the amount of heating power as its predecessor, the PAX 3 is able to fully heat up in just 15 seconds dependent on the temperature setting selected. Providing efficient and reliable performance almost instantly, you’ll never be left waiting for extended time to begin your session.
Discreet Size & Stylish Finish
Able to fit in the vast majority of pockets and slip discreetly into the palm of your hand, the PAX 3 is perfect for on-the-go use. Better still, its sleek matte finish provides a refreshing alternative to many other vapes on the market, further enhancing its discreet nature and leaving you safe in the knowledge you have one of the most stylish portably vaporizers currently available.
Vaporizes Herbs & Concentrates
When purchasing the complete kit, you’ll receive a handy concentrate insert. Allowing you to effortlessly switch between herbs and concentrates at your leisure, the PAX 3 is able to expertly vaporize both without ever compromising on quality or flavour.
Automatic Sensors
The cutting-edge technology of the PAX 3 utilizes multiple motion sensors to enhance your entire vaporizing experience. Providing an instant vibration when the device has fully heated to your chosen temperature, you’ll never be left aimlessly wondering whether your vape is ready to be used or not.
Better still, the built-in motion sensors only ensure maximum heat is produced when you bring the vape to your lips. Otherwise, it shuts itself off when sensing it’s being set down. Able to save impressive amounts of battery life and only providing heat precisely when you need it, the PAX 3 is hailed for its user-focused nature.
Smartphone App
Allowing you to tailor your vaping session without actually touching the device itself, the PAX 3 accompanying app is a real stand-out feature. Available on both Apple and Android devices, you can use the app to directly set your PAX 3 to a precise temperature, change the LED display colour, and even lock the device to ensure it isn’t switched on by accident. The use of this app is completely optional too, so you can still make the most out of your PAX 3 even if smartphone apps aren’t really your scene – the choice is entirely yours!
Note: As of 17th November 2019, Apple has restricted vaping apps on App Store, so unless you previously have downloaded a copy of the PAX app you won’t be able to control your PAX 3 from an iPhone.
Warranty
All PAX 3 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of PAX Labs products, are authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

It includes a large collapsible silicone bowl that, when expanded, provides a spill-safe area for weighing your material and when the bowl is collapsed it can be latched with a lid to keep the scale safe from knocks.
The results are easy to read from the extra-large LCD with pink backlight and the built-in overload protection helps prevent damage to the scale. Other features include automatic piece counting, power-saving auto-off after 3 minutes of inactivity, tare/zero feature for subtracting the weight of a container or expansion tray, and easy one-touch calibration.

Who is Wolkenkraft FX Mini for?
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini an affordable, ultra-portable convection vaporizer with great performance designed in Germany. It’s small, packs plenty of power and is full of features, but still performs reliably. The FX Mini is the perfect vape for those who want to experience true convection heating, and a solid, low-cost option for anyone serious about vaporizing.
Pure and tasty vapour
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini convection heating system fully extracts the chamber in just a few minutes. As no material touches the heating elements, there is no combustion, instead only the air heats up the material which ensures only pure and flavourful vapour is generated. The air path is sealed from the electronics, with an open airflow for comfortable draws.
Ultra-portable
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini isn’t just small - it’s one of the smallest vapes in our selection, measuring in at 5.1 × 7.6 × 2.5 cm and weighing just 136 grams. It’s easy to hide in the palm of your hand, or bring in a pocket, and is built for durability.
Good battery life
The 1600 mAh battery has a 30 to 40-minute run time, enough for six to eight four-minute sessions, depending on the temperature used. Most vaporizers in this size can only be used for three to four sessions before needing a recharge, but the Wolkenkraft FX Mini can be used for a lot longer than that!
30-second heat-up time
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini is ready to vape in just 25 to 30 seconds, depending on the temperature used and the battery level. Once it’s ready, you can draw in vapour continuously for four minutes, until the session timer expires (extendable by pushing the power button). This means you can have a quick session anywhere, or even use it for one quick hit and then put it back in your pocket.
Easy to use buttons
With no learning curve, the Wolkenkraft FX Mini is the perfect vape to pass around the room, or relax with by yourself. It has three buttons that work like you think they should - turn it on with three clicks of the big button, pick your favourite temperature from 160 to 221°C with the other two buttons, and wait for 25 seconds. It doesn’t get any easier than that!
Bright OLED-display
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini has been equipped with a large, bright and crystal-clear OLED display that shows you the battery charge level, the set temperature, the current temperature and the session timer. A session goes for 240 seconds (4 minutes) after which the FX Mini will shut down automatically. Simply press the power button 5 times again to turn it back on and start another session.
Quality components
The parts of the Wolkenkraft FX Mini coming in contact with your herbs and vapour are carefully selected for maximum purity and flavour. The chamber is made of titanium which makes it easy to clean and can hold up to 0.2 grams of dry herb. To draw in the vapour you use the extendable mouthpiece that is made out of food-grade safe Pyrex glass.
Not only for herbs
If you want to enjoy concentrates such as oil and waxes with the Wolkenkraft FX Mini, all you have to do is use the included concentrate capsule. Start by adding your concentrate to the capsule, insert the capsule in the chamber and then attach the mouthpiece. You are now ready to vape concentrates!
Warranty
All Wolkenkraft FX Mini sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Wolkenkraft products, are authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is Wolkenkraft FX Mini for?
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini an affordable, ultra-portable convection vaporizer with great performance designed in Germany. It’s small, packs plenty of power and is full of features, but still performs reliably. The FX Mini is the perfect vape for those who want to experience true convection heating, and a solid, low-cost option for anyone serious about vaporizing.
Pure and tasty vapour
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini convection heating system fully extracts the chamber in just a few minutes. As no material touches the heating elements, there is no combustion, instead only the air heats up the material which ensures only pure and flavourful vapour is generated. The air path is sealed from the electronics, with an open airflow for comfortable draws.
Ultra-portable
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini isn’t just small - it’s one of the smallest vapes in our selection, measuring in at 5.1 × 7.6 × 2.5 cm and weighing just 136 grams. It’s easy to hide in the palm of your hand, or bring in a pocket, and is built for durability.
Good battery life
The 1600 mAh battery has a 30 to 40-minute run time, enough for six to eight four-minute sessions, depending on the temperature used. Most vaporizers in this size can only be used for three to four sessions before needing a recharge, but the Wolkenkraft FX Mini can be used for a lot longer than that!
30-second heat-up time
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini is ready to vape in just 25 to 30 seconds, depending on the temperature used and the battery level. Once it’s ready, you can draw in vapour continuously for four minutes, until the session timer expires (extendable by pushing the power button). This means you can have a quick session anywhere, or even use it for one quick hit and then put it back in your pocket.
Easy to use buttons
With no learning curve, the Wolkenkraft FX Mini is the perfect vape to pass around the room, or relax with by yourself. It has three buttons that work like you think they should - turn it on with three clicks of the big button, pick your favourite temperature from 160 to 221°C with the other two buttons, and wait for 25 seconds. It doesn’t get any easier than that!
Bright OLED-display
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini has been equipped with a large, bright and crystal-clear OLED display that shows you the battery charge level, the set temperature, the current temperature and the session timer. A session goes for 240 seconds (4 minutes) after which the FX Mini will shut down automatically. Simply press the power button 5 times again to turn it back on and start another session.
Quality components
The parts of the Wolkenkraft FX Mini coming in contact with your herbs and vapour are carefully selected for maximum purity and flavour. The chamber is made of titanium which makes it easy to clean and can hold up to 0.2 grams of dry herb. To draw in the vapour you use the extendable mouthpiece that is made out of food-grade safe Pyrex glass.
Not only for herbs
If you want to enjoy concentrates such as oil and waxes with the Wolkenkraft FX Mini, all you have to do is use the included concentrate capsule. Start by adding your concentrate to the capsule, insert the capsule in the chamber and then attach the mouthpiece. You are now ready to vape concentrates!
Warranty

Who is Wolkenkraft FX Mini for?
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini an affordable, ultra-portable convection vaporizer with great performance designed in Germany. It’s small, packs plenty of power and is full of features, but still performs reliably. The FX Mini is the perfect vape for those who want to experience true convection heating, and a solid, low-cost option for anyone serious about vaporizing.
Pure and tasty vapour
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini convection heating system fully extracts the chamber in just a few minutes. As no material touches the heating elements, there is no combustion, instead only the air heats up the material which ensures only pure and flavourful vapour is generated. The air path is sealed from the electronics, with an open airflow for comfortable draws.
Ultra-portable
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini isn’t just small - it’s one of the smallest vapes in our selection, measuring in at 5.1 × 7.6 × 2.5 cm and weighing just 136 grams. It’s easy to hide in the palm of your hand, or bring in a pocket, and is built for durability.
Good battery life
The 1600 mAh battery has a 30 to 40-minute run time, enough for six to eight four-minute sessions, depending on the temperature used. Most vaporizers in this size can only be used for three to four sessions before needing a recharge, but the Wolkenkraft FX Mini can be used for a lot longer than that!
30-second heat-up time
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini is ready to vape in just 25 to 30 seconds, depending on the temperature used and the battery level. Once it’s ready, you can draw in vapour continuously for four minutes, until the session timer expires (extendable by pushing the power button). This means you can have a quick session anywhere, or even use it for one quick hit and then put it back in your pocket.
Easy to use buttons
With no learning curve, the Wolkenkraft FX Mini is the perfect vape to pass around the room, or relax with by yourself. It has three buttons that work like you think they should - turn it on with three clicks of the big button, pick your favourite temperature from 160 to 221°C with the other two buttons, and wait for 25 seconds. It doesn’t get any easier than that!
Bright OLED-display
The Wolkenkraft FX Mini has been equipped with a large, bright and crystal-clear OLED display that shows you the battery charge level, the set temperature, the current temperature and the session timer. A session goes for 240 seconds (4 minutes) after which the FX Mini will shut down automatically. Simply press the power button 5 times again to turn it back on and start another session.
Quality components
The parts of the Wolkenkraft FX Mini coming in contact with your herbs and vapour are carefully selected for maximum purity and flavour. The chamber is made of titanium which makes it easy to clean and can hold up to 0.2 grams of dry herb. To draw in the vapour you use the extendable mouthpiece that is made out of food-grade safe Pyrex glass.
Not only for herbs
If you want to enjoy concentrates such as oil and waxes with the Wolkenkraft FX Mini, all you have to do is use the included concentrate capsule. Start by adding your concentrate to the capsule, insert the capsule in the chamber and then attach the mouthpiece. You are now ready to vape concentrates!
Warranty
All Wolkenkraft FX Mini sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Wolkenkraft products, are authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is the Crafty Plus Vaporizer for?
With its improved technology and hugely impressive performance, the Crafty+ Vaporizer is equally suitable for both beginners and expert vapers. It’s designed to fit in your pocket, is simple to use and produces flavourful, cool vapour every time. The Crafty Plus is about half the size as its bigger brother, the Mighty, and makes an excellent choice for those looking for a vape that is smaller and more discreet – without compromising on quality.
What is new?
Storz & Bickel released the original Crafty vaporizer in 2014 and it has been updated several times since, but in late 2019 it received a big upgrade and a new name – the Crafty+.
The most significant improvement is the battery which now lasts longer, charges faster, and reduces the heat-up time to only 60 seconds. You are now also able to have three pre-set temperatures instead of just two like before.
It has also decreased in size thanks to a new circuit board and the outer shell has received a facelift making it look even more discreet. Finally, you will also be able to get one more year of warranty, from 2 to 3 years, if you choose to register your Crafty Plus with Storz & Bickel.
In 2021, the next generation of the Crafty+ vaporizer was released. This model features a USB-C socket which reduces charging time by 25 minutes and a ceramic coated filling chamber to make it even more resistant against scratches and damages.
Impressive Battery Life
Crafty+ provides up to a full 60 minutes of continuous vapour production on a full charge, which is surprisingly long considering its small size. A useful vibration mechanism will instantly alert you when the battery is getting low, providing plenty of time to get it charging and continue your session.
Versatile
Unlike most portable vapes The Crafty Plus can vaporize not only herbs but also oils and concentrates. Since you can select any temperature between from 40 to 210 °C you can select the optimal heat level and get dense, flavourful vapour clouds no matter what you choose to vaporize.
Bluetooth App
The app complementing the Crafty+ has been specifically designed to enhance your entire vaping experience. It’s available for both iPhone and Android and allows you to control the temperature, the LED display brightness and also gives you the option of deactivating its vibrating feature should you so wish.
You can also save your favourite temperature settings for future sessions, as the app provides full control without having to touch the device itself. If apps aren’t your thing, you don’t have to worry as use of the app is entirely optional and you can easily control it by simply using the device’s built-in buttons – the choice is entirely yours!
Note: As of 17th November 2019, Apple has restricted vaping apps on App Store, so unless you previously have a downloaded copy of the Storz & Bickel app you need to use a web browser app to control your Crafty Plus from an iPhone.
Strong Performance
Both convection and conduction heating are utilized by the Crafty+ as it features a built-in patented heat exchanger that guarantees a premium performance every time. It’s able to deliver a stable temperature level throughout your entire session meaning you will get dense, flavourful and smooth vapour no matter how quickly you breathe in.
Easy to Clean
Many vaporizers require incredibly complex navigation for disassembling and cleaning purposes, but the Crafty Plus vaporizer has been specifically designed with simplicity in mind. Not only are all components made of the highest possible material quality, but they’re also very easy to take apart without causing damage. This smart design allows you to easily clean this vape thoroughly to ensure maximum hygiene and longevity without wasting time that could be used for vaping instead!
Warranty
All Crafty+ vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)
£89
£119
Features
Induction heating
Great at heating DynaVap vaporizers
Full temperature control (120°C to 425°C)
Borosilicate glass cups
Removable batteries (2 × 2900 mAh)
Safety features
The Wand by Ispire is a portable induction heater for use with concentrates, and in addition to that, it’s also great at heating the tips of DynaVap vaporizers.
What is induction heat?
Induction heat is a highly accurate, controllable, and more predictable heat source than the torches used normally used for this kind of vaping, so you’re going to experience consistency and less waste by eliminating over- or under-heating. Select any temperature you want in 5-degree increments, from 120°C to 425°C.
Wand Glass Adapter for DynaVap vaporizers
If you plan on using the Wand with a DynaVap vaporizer, we recommend getting the Wand Glass Adapter so you can lodge the tip instead of having to swirl it around for even heat. With it, you no longer need to keep an eye on it and can use it hands-free. Just sit back and wait for the “click” of the Captive Cap.
Automatic and manual mode
You can use it in one of two modes, either manual mode or automatic mode. To use it in manual mode, hold the large button down until the cup or your DynaVap reaches your set temperature.
When you first hold the button down the Wand will blink with a red light, then once you put over something metal it will engage the induction heating and pulse a white light while it’s heating up. When it arrives at your set temperature the white light will stay on, meaning you can go ahead and enjoy whatever you're heating.
To use it in automatic mode, double press the large button, and then place it on the induction cup or put your DynaVap in it. One great thing about the automatic mode is that you can take it off and on throughout the cycle and it will just re-engage the heating, so you can sort of feather the heat while in use.
Removable batteries
The Wand is powered by two replaceable 2900 mAh batteries that can be charged with the included USB-C cable, or externally if you have a charger for 18650 batteries.

Duality Torch

The Duality is a high-quality butane torch lighter. It has a pocket-proof ignition and a single or double flame to choose from depending on your preference. It also features a large tank window that allows you to keep an eye on the fuel level, as well as making it easy to refill it without issue. The flame can be adjusted with the dial at the bottom and the flint ignition can be replaced if it gets worn out.
It ships empty so you need to add butane gas to it before you can use it.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Intended for use with: DynaVap B, DynaVap M, DynaVap M+ (Plus), DynaVap Omni and DynaVap VonG (i): Titanium.

Cyclone Triple Torch

£15
The Vertigo Cyclone Triple Torch is one of the most budget friendly torch lighters you will ever find. It features a large, clear fuel tank so you’ll always know how much fuel remains and it also makes refilling it a lot easier. The wind resistant flame is capable of lighting at 3'500 meters above sea level.
Fill it with filtered butane gas, available at hobby stores and Amazon, before use (not included). We recommend using the brand Colibri but any butane gas that has been filtered at least five times should work well.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Do not clean the Cyclone Triple Torch with alcohol as this will degrade the plastic, resulting in fuel leaks.

DynaVap M Features
Made of stainless steel
Perfect for micro-dosing
On-demand vapour
Unique “clicking” cap
Hybrid heating
Designed and manufactured in USA
Who is the DynaVap M for?
The VapCap M by DynaVap is perfect for anyone looking for an easy-to-use, manually controlled vape with a practically indestructible build. The simple design produces tasty, reliable vapour and allows for stealthy vape sessions where other vaporizers would draw too much attention.
The new things on this version are the revamped chiral airport, an “M’ shaped air intake for easy rocking and adjustments, and updated geometrical indentations on both the tip and body for a slick, stylish finish.
What’s new with the “M” edition?
To ensure maximum flavour, the DynaVap M is still constructed from medical grade stainless steel but it now features the new “Captive Cap” with two small indentations near the end to keep the cap securely in place without affecting the airflow.
Another great feature is that you can adjust the bowl size to half the size for easier micro-dosing. If you are a fan of cooling the vapour you will also appreciate the improved tapered mouthpiece which lets you connect it to a water tool quick and easy.
Manually controlled
The DynaVap M can be heated by practically any external heat source, such as a blowtorch or induction heater. Thanks to this ingenious design it can deliver powerful and tasty hits from tiny amounts of herbs, instantly. The ‘cap’ makes an audible click when it has have reached the minimum temperature and is ready to start the vapour production.
With the DynaVap M’s manual heating, you’re in complete control of the vapour density. Create fast and light vapour, or a thick and heavy vapour, depending on where you heat the cap. Even with the small bowl size, every hit is full of potency and flavour.
Custom bowl size
If you like to match your herb consumption with the occasion you will appreciate that the DynaVap M bowl has two settings - 0.1 grams and 0.05 grams. Perfect for micro-dosing! The stainless-steel bowl is surprisingly effective, even with small amounts of herbs loaded. It's also quick to reload, so you can vape the next bowl quickly after finishing the last one.
It’s capable of vaporizing the entire bowl in 1 to 2 hits but if you don’t finish you can even return to the same bowl later since the DynaVap M does not heat your herb between inhales.
Convenient to bring everywhere
The DynaVap M is 9 centimetres long and weighs only 19 grams, which makes it one of the smallest vape on the market. It’s not just the perfect vaporizer for festivals and camping, it’s also ideal for any traveller as the and the only other things you need are a lighter and some herbs. No other portable dry herb vaporizer offers such instant and powerful vapour at such a reasonable price.
How to use it?
Load the DynaVap M by either adding your herbs to the top or press the tip in the herbs a few times to load it. Use your finger to dust off any excess herbs and put the cap on.
Once your bowl is filled, heat the cap with either a torch or an induction heater until you hear the famous DynaVap “click” that lets you know it’s ready to be used. You can control the airflow by covering the air intake while hitting for thicker vapour, or leave it uncovered for lighter and smoother hits.
Warranty
All DynaVap M vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DynaVap products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)
£89
£119
Features
Induction heating
Great at heating DynaVap vaporizers
Full temperature control (120°C to 425°C)
Borosilicate glass cups
Removable batteries (2 × 2900 mAh)
Safety features
The Wand by Ispire is a portable induction heater for use with concentrates, and in addition to that, it’s also great at heating the tips of DynaVap vaporizers.
What is induction heat?
Induction heat is a highly accurate, controllable, and more predictable heat source than the torches used normally used for this kind of vaping, so you’re going to experience consistency and less waste by eliminating over- or under-heating. Select any temperature you want in 5-degree increments, from 120°C to 425°C.
Wand Glass Adapter for DynaVap vaporizers
If you plan on using the Wand with a DynaVap vaporizer, we recommend getting the Wand Glass Adapter so you can lodge the tip instead of having to swirl it around for even heat. With it, you no longer need to keep an eye on it and can use it hands-free. Just sit back and wait for the “click” of the Captive Cap.
Automatic and manual mode
You can use it in one of two modes, either manual mode or automatic mode. To use it in manual mode, hold the large button down until the cup or your DynaVap reaches your set temperature.
When you first hold the button down the Wand will blink with a red light, then once you put over something metal it will engage the induction heating and pulse a white light while it’s heating up. When it arrives at your set temperature the white light will stay on, meaning you can go ahead and enjoy whatever you're heating.
To use it in automatic mode, double press the large button, and then place it on the induction cup or put your DynaVap in it. One great thing about the automatic mode is that you can take it off and on throughout the cycle and it will just re-engage the heating, so you can sort of feather the heat while in use.
Removable batteries
The Wand is powered by two replaceable 2900 mAh batteries that can be charged with the included USB-C cable, or externally if you have a charger for 18650 batteries.

The Duality is a high-quality butane torch lighter. It has a pocket-proof ignition and a single or double flame to choose from depending on your preference. It also features a large tank window that allows you to keep an eye on the fuel level, as well as making it easy to refill it without issue. The flame can be adjusted with the dial at the bottom and the flint ignition can be replaced if it gets worn out.
It ships empty so you need to add butane gas to it before you can use it.

Fill it with filtered butane gas, available at hobby stores and Amazon, before use (not included). We recommend using the brand Colibri but any butane gas that has been filtered at least five times should work well.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Do not clean the Cyclone Triple Torch with alcohol as this will degrade the plastic, resulting in fuel leaks.

DynaVap M Features
Made of stainless steel
Perfect for micro-dosing
On-demand vapour
Unique “clicking” cap
Hybrid heating
Designed and manufactured in USA
Who is the DynaVap M for?
The VapCap M by DynaVap is perfect for anyone looking for an easy-to-use, manually controlled vape with a practically indestructible build. The simple design produces tasty, reliable vapour and allows for stealthy vape sessions where other vaporizers would draw too much attention.
The new things on this version are the revamped chiral airport, an “M’ shaped air intake for easy rocking and adjustments, and updated geometrical indentations on both the tip and body for a slick, stylish finish.
What’s new with the “M” edition?
To ensure maximum flavour, the DynaVap M is still constructed from medical grade stainless steel but it now features the new “Captive Cap” with two small indentations near the end to keep the cap securely in place without affecting the airflow.
Another great feature is that you can adjust the bowl size to half the size for easier micro-dosing. If you are a fan of cooling the vapour you will also appreciate the improved tapered mouthpiece which lets you connect it to a water tool quick and easy.
Manually controlled
The DynaVap M can be heated by practically any external heat source, such as a blowtorch or induction heater. Thanks to this ingenious design it can deliver powerful and tasty hits from tiny amounts of herbs, instantly. The ‘cap’ makes an audible click when it has have reached the minimum temperature and is ready to start the vapour production.
With the DynaVap M’s manual heating, you’re in complete control of the vapour density. Create fast and light vapour, or a thick and heavy vapour, depending on where you heat the cap. Even with the small bowl size, every hit is full of potency and flavour.
Custom bowl size
If you like to match your herb consumption with the occasion you will appreciate that the DynaVap M bowl has two settings - 0.1 grams and 0.05 grams. Perfect for micro-dosing! The stainless-steel bowl is surprisingly effective, even with small amounts of herbs loaded. It's also quick to reload, so you can vape the next bowl quickly after finishing the last one.
It’s capable of vaporizing the entire bowl in 1 to 2 hits but if you don’t finish you can even return to the same bowl later since the DynaVap M does not heat your herb between inhales.
Convenient to bring everywhere
The DynaVap M is 9 centimetres long and weighs only 19 grams, which makes it one of the smallest vape on the market. It’s not just the perfect vaporizer for festivals and camping, it’s also ideal for any traveller as the and the only other things you need are a lighter and some herbs. No other portable dry herb vaporizer offers such instant and powerful vapour at such a reasonable price.
How to use it?
Load the DynaVap M by either adding your herbs to the top or press the tip in the herbs a few times to load it. Use your finger to dust off any excess herbs and put the cap on.
Once your bowl is filled, heat the cap with either a torch or an induction heater until you hear the famous DynaVap “click” that lets you know it’s ready to be used. You can control the airflow by covering the air intake while hitting for thicker vapour, or leave it uncovered for lighter and smoother hits.
Warranty
All DynaVap M vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DynaVap products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

To be compatible with most DynaVap models, the Armored Cap retains the classic look and design of the Captive Cap, including the built-in digger tool. It has a sleek matte grey finish that will develop a beautiful patina over time. You can easily aim your flame at the mini logo for consistent and satisfying vapour every time.
Intended for use with: DynaVap M, DynaVap M+ (Plus), DynaVap Omni and DynaVap VonG (i): Titanium.

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)
£89
£119
Features
Induction heating
Great at heating DynaVap vaporizers
Full temperature control (120°C to 425°C)
Borosilicate glass cups
Removable batteries (2 × 2900 mAh)
Safety features
The Wand by Ispire is a portable induction heater for use with concentrates, and in addition to that, it’s also great at heating the tips of DynaVap vaporizers.
What is induction heat?
Induction heat is a highly accurate, controllable, and more predictable heat source than the torches used normally used for this kind of vaping, so you’re going to experience consistency and less waste by eliminating over- or under-heating. Select any temperature you want in 5-degree increments, from 120°C to 425°C.
Wand Glass Adapter for DynaVap vaporizers
If you plan on using the Wand with a DynaVap vaporizer, we recommend getting the Wand Glass Adapter so you can lodge the tip instead of having to swirl it around for even heat. With it, you no longer need to keep an eye on it and can use it hands-free. Just sit back and wait for the “click” of the Captive Cap.
Automatic and manual mode
You can use it in one of two modes, either manual mode or automatic mode. To use it in manual mode, hold the large button down until the cup or your DynaVap reaches your set temperature.
When you first hold the button down the Wand will blink with a red light, then once you put over something metal it will engage the induction heating and pulse a white light while it’s heating up. When it arrives at your set temperature the white light will stay on, meaning you can go ahead and enjoy whatever you're heating.
To use it in automatic mode, double press the large button, and then place it on the induction cup or put your DynaVap in it. One great thing about the automatic mode is that you can take it off and on throughout the cycle and it will just re-engage the heating, so you can sort of feather the heat while in use.
Removable batteries
The Wand is powered by two replaceable 2900 mAh batteries that can be charged with the included USB-C cable, or externally if you have a charger for 18650 batteries.

Duality Torch

The Duality is a high-quality butane torch lighter. It has a pocket-proof ignition and a single or double flame to choose from depending on your preference. It also features a large tank window that allows you to keep an eye on the fuel level, as well as making it easy to refill it without issue. The flame can be adjusted with the dial at the bottom and the flint ignition can be replaced if it gets worn out.
It ships empty so you need to add butane gas to it before you can use it.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Intended for use with: DynaVap B, DynaVap M, DynaVap M+ (Plus), DynaVap Omni and DynaVap VonG (i): Titanium.

The Vertigo Cyclone Triple Torch is one of the most budget friendly torch lighters you will ever find. It features a large, clear fuel tank so you’ll always know how much fuel remains and it also makes refilling it a lot easier. The wind resistant flame is capable of lighting at 3'500 meters above sea level.
Fill it with filtered butane gas, available at hobby stores and Amazon, before use (not included). We recommend using the brand Colibri but any butane gas that has been filtered at least five times should work well.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Do not clean the Cyclone Triple Torch with alcohol as this will degrade the plastic, resulting in fuel leaks.

DynaVap M Features
Made of stainless steel
Perfect for micro-dosing
On-demand vapour
Unique “clicking” cap
Hybrid heating
Designed and manufactured in USA
Who is the DynaVap M for?
The VapCap M by DynaVap is perfect for anyone looking for an easy-to-use, manually controlled vape with a practically indestructible build. The simple design produces tasty, reliable vapour and allows for stealthy vape sessions where other vaporizers would draw too much attention.
The new things on this version are the revamped chiral airport, an “M’ shaped air intake for easy rocking and adjustments, and updated geometrical indentations on both the tip and body for a slick, stylish finish.
What’s new with the “M” edition?
To ensure maximum flavour, the DynaVap M is still constructed from medical grade stainless steel but it now features the new “Captive Cap” with two small indentations near the end to keep the cap securely in place without affecting the airflow.
Another great feature is that you can adjust the bowl size to half the size for easier micro-dosing. If you are a fan of cooling the vapour you will also appreciate the improved tapered mouthpiece which lets you connect it to a water tool quick and easy.
Manually controlled
The DynaVap M can be heated by practically any external heat source, such as a blowtorch or induction heater. Thanks to this ingenious design it can deliver powerful and tasty hits from tiny amounts of herbs, instantly. The ‘cap’ makes an audible click when it has have reached the minimum temperature and is ready to start the vapour production.
With the DynaVap M’s manual heating, you’re in complete control of the vapour density. Create fast and light vapour, or a thick and heavy vapour, depending on where you heat the cap. Even with the small bowl size, every hit is full of potency and flavour.
Custom bowl size
If you like to match your herb consumption with the occasion you will appreciate that the DynaVap M bowl has two settings - 0.1 grams and 0.05 grams. Perfect for micro-dosing! The stainless-steel bowl is surprisingly effective, even with small amounts of herbs loaded. It's also quick to reload, so you can vape the next bowl quickly after finishing the last one.
It’s capable of vaporizing the entire bowl in 1 to 2 hits but if you don’t finish you can even return to the same bowl later since the DynaVap M does not heat your herb between inhales.
Convenient to bring everywhere
The DynaVap M is 9 centimetres long and weighs only 19 grams, which makes it one of the smallest vape on the market. It’s not just the perfect vaporizer for festivals and camping, it’s also ideal for any traveller as the and the only other things you need are a lighter and some herbs. No other portable dry herb vaporizer offers such instant and powerful vapour at such a reasonable price.
How to use it?
Load the DynaVap M by either adding your herbs to the top or press the tip in the herbs a few times to load it. Use your finger to dust off any excess herbs and put the cap on.
Once your bowl is filled, heat the cap with either a torch or an induction heater until you hear the famous DynaVap “click” that lets you know it’s ready to be used. You can control the airflow by covering the air intake while hitting for thicker vapour, or leave it uncovered for lighter and smoother hits.
Warranty
All DynaVap M vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DynaVap products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)
£89
£119
Features
Induction heating
Great at heating DynaVap vaporizers
Full temperature control (120°C to 425°C)
Borosilicate glass cups
Removable batteries (2 × 2900 mAh)
Safety features
The Wand by Ispire is a portable induction heater for use with concentrates, and in addition to that, it’s also great at heating the tips of DynaVap vaporizers.
What is induction heat?
Induction heat is a highly accurate, controllable, and more predictable heat source than the torches used normally used for this kind of vaping, so you’re going to experience consistency and less waste by eliminating over- or under-heating. Select any temperature you want in 5-degree increments, from 120°C to 425°C.
Wand Glass Adapter for DynaVap vaporizers
If you plan on using the Wand with a DynaVap vaporizer, we recommend getting the Wand Glass Adapter so you can lodge the tip instead of having to swirl it around for even heat. With it, you no longer need to keep an eye on it and can use it hands-free. Just sit back and wait for the “click” of the Captive Cap.
Automatic and manual mode
You can use it in one of two modes, either manual mode or automatic mode. To use it in manual mode, hold the large button down until the cup or your DynaVap reaches your set temperature.
When you first hold the button down the Wand will blink with a red light, then once you put over something metal it will engage the induction heating and pulse a white light while it’s heating up. When it arrives at your set temperature the white light will stay on, meaning you can go ahead and enjoy whatever you're heating.
To use it in automatic mode, double press the large button, and then place it on the induction cup or put your DynaVap in it. One great thing about the automatic mode is that you can take it off and on throughout the cycle and it will just re-engage the heating, so you can sort of feather the heat while in use.
Removable batteries
The Wand is powered by two replaceable 2900 mAh batteries that can be charged with the included USB-C cable, or externally if you have a charger for 18650 batteries.

Straight banger

Duality Torch

Duality Torch
£29
£38
The Duality is a high-quality butane torch lighter. It has a pocket-proof ignition and a single or double flame to choose from depending on your preference. It also features a large tank window that allows you to keep an eye on the fuel level, as well as making it easy to refill it without issue. The flame can be adjusted with the dial at the bottom and the flint ignition can be replaced if it gets worn out.
It ships empty so you need to add butane gas to it before you can use it.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Intended for use with: DynaVap B, DynaVap M, DynaVap M+ (Plus), DynaVap Omni and DynaVap VonG (i): Titanium.

Cyclone Triple Torch

The Vertigo Cyclone Triple Torch is one of the most budget friendly torch lighters you will ever find. It features a large, clear fuel tank so you’ll always know how much fuel remains and it also makes refilling it a lot easier. The wind resistant flame is capable of lighting at 3'500 meters above sea level.
Fill it with filtered butane gas, available at hobby stores and Amazon, before use (not included). We recommend using the brand Colibri but any butane gas that has been filtered at least five times should work well.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Do not clean the Cyclone Triple Torch with alcohol as this will degrade the plastic, resulting in fuel leaks.

DynaVap M Features
Made of stainless steel
Perfect for micro-dosing
On-demand vapour
Unique “clicking” cap
Hybrid heating
Designed and manufactured in USA
Who is the DynaVap M for?
The VapCap M by DynaVap is perfect for anyone looking for an easy-to-use, manually controlled vape with a practically indestructible build. The simple design produces tasty, reliable vapour and allows for stealthy vape sessions where other vaporizers would draw too much attention.
The new things on this version are the revamped chiral airport, an “M’ shaped air intake for easy rocking and adjustments, and updated geometrical indentations on both the tip and body for a slick, stylish finish.
What’s new with the “M” edition?
To ensure maximum flavour, the DynaVap M is still constructed from medical grade stainless steel but it now features the new “Captive Cap” with two small indentations near the end to keep the cap securely in place without affecting the airflow.
Another great feature is that you can adjust the bowl size to half the size for easier micro-dosing. If you are a fan of cooling the vapour you will also appreciate the improved tapered mouthpiece which lets you connect it to a water tool quick and easy.
Manually controlled
The DynaVap M can be heated by practically any external heat source, such as a blowtorch or induction heater. Thanks to this ingenious design it can deliver powerful and tasty hits from tiny amounts of herbs, instantly. The ‘cap’ makes an audible click when it has have reached the minimum temperature and is ready to start the vapour production.
With the DynaVap M’s manual heating, you’re in complete control of the vapour density. Create fast and light vapour, or a thick and heavy vapour, depending on where you heat the cap. Even with the small bowl size, every hit is full of potency and flavour.
Custom bowl size
If you like to match your herb consumption with the occasion you will appreciate that the DynaVap M bowl has two settings - 0.1 grams and 0.05 grams. Perfect for micro-dosing! The stainless-steel bowl is surprisingly effective, even with small amounts of herbs loaded. It's also quick to reload, so you can vape the next bowl quickly after finishing the last one.
It’s capable of vaporizing the entire bowl in 1 to 2 hits but if you don’t finish you can even return to the same bowl later since the DynaVap M does not heat your herb between inhales.
Convenient to bring everywhere
The DynaVap M is 9 centimetres long and weighs only 19 grams, which makes it one of the smallest vape on the market. It’s not just the perfect vaporizer for festivals and camping, it’s also ideal for any traveller as the and the only other things you need are a lighter and some herbs. No other portable dry herb vaporizer offers such instant and powerful vapour at such a reasonable price.
How to use it?
Load the DynaVap M by either adding your herbs to the top or press the tip in the herbs a few times to load it. Use your finger to dust off any excess herbs and put the cap on.
Once your bowl is filled, heat the cap with either a torch or an induction heater until you hear the famous DynaVap “click” that lets you know it’s ready to be used. You can control the airflow by covering the air intake while hitting for thicker vapour, or leave it uncovered for lighter and smoother hits.
Warranty
All DynaVap M vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DynaVap products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Mighty Vape Features
New UK version with 20% better battery (2023.07)
The most powerful portable vape
Easy to use
Pure vapour of the highest quality
Stylish and durable
Precise temperature control (40-210°C)
Who is the Storz & Bickel Mighty for?
The perfect choice for those seeking a top-quality, no frills vaporizer that guarantees premium results every time, the Mighty Vaporizer is a real force to be reckoned with. Super easy to operate and offering premium vapour at all times with its innovative dual heating method, the Mighty Vaporizer is a great choice if you value both quality and performance when vaping.
Whilst a little too large to fit into most pockets, this vaporizer can easily be carried in a bag or purse making it suitable for both on-the-go and at-home use. The only disadvantage of it is the high price compared to other portable vapes, but If you value both quality and performance, you will quickly understand why Mighty is priced relatively high.
Full Temperature Control
Unlike many other vaporizers on the market only offering specific pre-set temperatures for you to choose from, the Mighty Vaporizer provides full control. Allowing you to select any temperature between 40°C and 210°C, the power is solely in your hands. And due to the simplistic plus and minus arrow buttons on its surface, changing this device’s temperature couldn’t be easier – especially useful for beginners.
Impressive Battery Power
Powered by two built-in lithium batteries, the Mighty Vaporizer by Storz & Bickel can provide up to 120 minutes of continuous vaping from just one charging cycle. And when the batteries need to be charged, you can still use this vaporizer with the power adapter provided whilst charging is taking place.
Conduction & Convection Heating
Able to provide continuous high performance to ensure the best quality vapour possible, the Mighty Vaporizer utilizes two impressive heating methods to produce results. Generating heated air to provide constant heat during the evaporation stage for optimum temperature maintenance, its radiation heat guarantees instant quality vapour from the outset.
Never leaving you waiting multiple breaths for top quality, great tasting vapour to be produced, the Mighty Vaporizer guarantees premium performance throughout your entire session.
Automatic Switch Off
Specifically in place to conserve battery life but also maintain maximum safety for yourself and other users, the Mighty vaporizer’s automatic switch off feature is a definite bonus. With the ability to switch itself off after two minutes of activity, if you find yourself slowly dozing off you won’t have to force yourself away to turn off the device.
Better still, the activation of the automatic switch-off function is indication by a brief vibration, meaning you’ll always be notified if the Mighty is deactivating its power. In addition to your safety, this nifty feature also successfully conserves battery life, meaning you can vape for longer without resorting to the power adapter.
Easy to Use
Whilst the Mighty’s impressive performance level makes it a great choice for experienced vaping enthusiasts, its easy operation is also suitable for beginners too. Featuring just two buttons resembling a plus and minus arrow, altering temperature and controlling this device requires no complex mechanisms whatsoever. And with a handy central LED display to provide accurate temperature readings and battery status, you’ll always be in-the-know about how the Mighty Vaporizer is performing.
Warranty
All Mighty Vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries
£149
£199
Reduce temperature, increase humidity, maximize efficiency, and experience the finest vapour available with the Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries. You can use it with balloons (Easy Valve) and with the tube (if you have a Volcano Hybrid).
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler for Volcano vaporizers reduces the temperature of the vapour (up to 40°C less) while simultaneously adding humidity (over 93%+) to it which makes it much less harsh on your throat and lungs. Thanks to the lower temperature and increased humidity you can vaporize at temperatures higher than you normally would, without coughing, and you can, therefore, extract more of your herbs or concentrate.
You don't have to worry about water spills either as the Obsidian Glass Bubbler features a secondary water trap (not included on Magma Bubbler). This helps prevent getting moisture or liquid mixed in with your herbs or concentrates in the rare case of unintentional overfills or accidents.
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler is constructed from the highest quality grade borosilicate glass that is easy to clean with isopropyl alcohol. It is hand blown by master glass artisans to ensure a precision fit with your Easy Valve filling chamber for a perfect seal, every time.
Intended for use with: Volcano Digit, Volcano Classic UK and Volcano Hybrid UK.

Who is the Volcano Hybrid for?
For those seeking the absolute best in desktop vaping, the brand-new Volcano Hybrid is definitely worth considering. Utilizing the most advanced technology possible in creating an outstanding vaping experience, the sleek design and cutting-edge mechanisms make this vaporizer stand out from the rest. The Volcano Hybrid is for those who truly take vaping seriously and who wants to buy a vaporizer that will last them decades.
Premium Design
Exclusively manufactured in Germany using the highest quality materials available, the Volcano Hybrid both looks and feels effortlessly luxurious. Its sleek digital display features a nifty control panel in addition to providing precise temperature readings throughout your entire session. Better still, all buttons featured are touchable as opposed to requiring a press, giving this vaporizer an instantly sophisticated yet modern twist.
Optimum Vapour Quality
Like its predecessors, one of the main focuses of the Volcano Hybrid is producing vapour of maximum quality & taste – and it certainly doesn’t disappoint! Its contemporary rotatable tube system allows you to decide precisely how much vapour you wish to take in, providing ultimate flexibility and control over your experience. Also included is the traditional Easy Valve balloon system which means multiple inhalation methods are available to you.
Convenient App Control
Volcano Hybrid also has an app compatible with both iOS & Android devices. All you need is a working Bluetooth connection and you’re good to go! The app allows you to easily adjust all the settings this vape offers without having to actually touch the vape itself which means you can control your entire session remotely just using your smartphone. It also allows you to set up workflows that control the temperature and the pumping for different timed intervals.
Note: As of 17th November 2019, Apple has restricted vaping apps on App Store, so unless you previously have a downloaded copy of the Storz & Bickel app you need to use a web browser to control the Volcano Hybrid from an iPhone.

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries
£149
£199
Reduce temperature, increase humidity, maximize efficiency, and experience the finest vapour available with the Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries. You can use it with balloons (Easy Valve) and with the tube (if you have a Volcano Hybrid).
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler for Volcano vaporizers reduces the temperature of the vapour (up to 40°C less) while simultaneously adding humidity (over 93%+) to it which makes it much less harsh on your throat and lungs. Thanks to the lower temperature and increased humidity you can vaporize at temperatures higher than you normally would, without coughing, and you can, therefore, extract more of your herbs or concentrate.
You don't have to worry about water spills either as the Obsidian Glass Bubbler features a secondary water trap (not included on Magma Bubbler). This helps prevent getting moisture or liquid mixed in with your herbs or concentrates in the rare case of unintentional overfills or accidents.
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler is constructed from the highest quality grade borosilicate glass that is easy to clean with isopropyl alcohol. It is hand blown by master glass artisans to ensure a precision fit with your Easy Valve filling chamber for a perfect seal, every time.
Intended for use with: Volcano Digit, Volcano Classic UK and Volcano Hybrid UK.

Who is the Volcano Hybrid for?
For those seeking the absolute best in desktop vaping, the brand-new Volcano Hybrid is definitely worth considering. Utilizing the most advanced technology possible in creating an outstanding vaping experience, the sleek design and cutting-edge mechanisms make this vaporizer stand out from the rest. The Volcano Hybrid is for those who truly take vaping seriously and who wants to buy a vaporizer that will last them decades.
Premium Design
Exclusively manufactured in Germany using the highest quality materials available, the Volcano Hybrid both looks and feels effortlessly luxurious. Its sleek digital display features a nifty control panel in addition to providing precise temperature readings throughout your entire session. Better still, all buttons featured are touchable as opposed to requiring a press, giving this vaporizer an instantly sophisticated yet modern twist.
Optimum Vapour Quality
Like its predecessors, one of the main focuses of the Volcano Hybrid is producing vapour of maximum quality & taste – and it certainly doesn’t disappoint! Its contemporary rotatable tube system allows you to decide precisely how much vapour you wish to take in, providing ultimate flexibility and control over your experience. Also included is the traditional Easy Valve balloon system which means multiple inhalation methods are available to you.
Convenient App Control
Volcano Hybrid also has an app compatible with both iOS & Android devices. All you need is a working Bluetooth connection and you’re good to go! The app allows you to easily adjust all the settings this vape offers without having to actually touch the vape itself which means you can control your entire session remotely just using your smartphone. It also allows you to set up workflows that control the temperature and the pumping for different timed intervals.
Note: As of 17th November 2019, Apple has restricted vaping apps on App Store, so unless you previously have a downloaded copy of the Storz & Bickel app you need to use a web browser to control the Volcano Hybrid from an iPhone.
Faster Heat-Up Time
Offering an even speedier heating time than previous models, the Volcano Hybrid can fully heat-up and be used within a mere 40 seconds. Its integrated double helix heat exchanger makes such quick heating possible and 100% safe, meaning you’ll never be left waiting feeling frustrated for your session to begin.
Warranty
All Volcano Hybrid vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries
£149
£199
Reduce temperature, increase humidity, maximize efficiency, and experience the finest vapour available with the Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries. You can use it with balloons (Easy Valve) and with the tube (if you have a Volcano Hybrid).
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler for Volcano vaporizers reduces the temperature of the vapour (up to 40°C less) while simultaneously adding humidity (over 93%+) to it which makes it much less harsh on your throat and lungs. Thanks to the lower temperature and increased humidity you can vaporize at temperatures higher than you normally would, without coughing, and you can, therefore, extract more of your herbs or concentrate.
You don't have to worry about water spills either as the Obsidian Glass Bubbler features a secondary water trap (not included on Magma Bubbler). This helps prevent getting moisture or liquid mixed in with your herbs or concentrates in the rare case of unintentional overfills or accidents.
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler is constructed from the highest quality grade borosilicate glass that is easy to clean with isopropyl alcohol. It is hand blown by master glass artisans to ensure a precision fit with your Easy Valve filling chamber for a perfect seal, every time.
Intended for use with: Volcano Digit, Volcano Classic UK and Volcano Hybrid UK.

Who is the Volcano Hybrid for?
For those seeking the absolute best in desktop vaping, the brand-new Volcano Hybrid is definitely worth considering. Utilizing the most advanced technology possible in creating an outstanding vaping experience, the sleek design and cutting-edge mechanisms make this vaporizer stand out from the rest. The Volcano Hybrid is for those who truly take vaping seriously and who wants to buy a vaporizer that will last them decades.
Premium Design
Exclusively manufactured in Germany using the highest quality materials available, the Volcano Hybrid both looks and feels effortlessly luxurious. Its sleek digital display features a nifty control panel in addition to providing precise temperature readings throughout your entire session. Better still, all buttons featured are touchable as opposed to requiring a press, giving this vaporizer an instantly sophisticated yet modern twist.
Optimum Vapour Quality
Like its predecessors, one of the main focuses of the Volcano Hybrid is producing vapour of maximum quality & taste – and it certainly doesn’t disappoint! Its contemporary rotatable tube system allows you to decide precisely how much vapour you wish to take in, providing ultimate flexibility and control over your experience. Also included is the traditional Easy Valve balloon system which means multiple inhalation methods are available to you.
Convenient App Control
Volcano Hybrid also has an app compatible with both iOS & Android devices. All you need is a working Bluetooth connection and you’re good to go! The app allows you to easily adjust all the settings this vape offers without having to actually touch the vape itself which means you can control your entire session remotely just using your smartphone. It also allows you to set up workflows that control the temperature and the pumping for different timed intervals.
Note: As of 17th November 2019, Apple has restricted vaping apps on App Store, so unless you previously have a downloaded copy of the Storz & Bickel app you need to use a web browser to control the Volcano Hybrid from an iPhone.
Faster Heat-Up Time
Offering an even speedier heating time than previous models, the Volcano Hybrid can fully heat-up and be used within a mere 40 seconds. Its integrated double helix heat exchanger makes such quick heating possible and 100% safe, meaning you’ll never be left waiting feeling frustrated for your session to begin.
Warranty
All Volcano Hybrid vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries
£149
£199
Reduce temperature, increase humidity, maximize efficiency, and experience the finest vapour available with the Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries. You can use it with balloons (Easy Valve) and with the tube (if you have a Volcano Hybrid).
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler for Volcano vaporizers reduces the temperature of the vapour (up to 40°C less) while simultaneously adding humidity (over 93%+) to it which makes it much less harsh on your throat and lungs. Thanks to the lower temperature and increased humidity you can vaporize at temperatures higher than you normally would, without coughing, and you can, therefore, extract more of your herbs or concentrate.
You don't have to worry about water spills either as the Obsidian Glass Bubbler features a secondary water trap (not included on Magma Bubbler). This helps prevent getting moisture or liquid mixed in with your herbs or concentrates in the rare case of unintentional overfills or accidents.
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler is constructed from the highest quality grade borosilicate glass that is easy to clean with isopropyl alcohol. It is hand blown by master glass artisans to ensure a precision fit with your Easy Valve filling chamber for a perfect seal, every time.
Intended for use with: Volcano Digit, Volcano Classic UK and Volcano Hybrid UK.

Who is the Volcano Hybrid for?
For those seeking the absolute best in desktop vaping, the brand-new Volcano Hybrid is definitely worth considering. Utilizing the most advanced technology possible in creating an outstanding vaping experience, the sleek design and cutting-edge mechanisms make this vaporizer stand out from the rest. The Volcano Hybrid is for those who truly take vaping seriously and who wants to buy a vaporizer that will last them decades.
Premium Design
Exclusively manufactured in Germany using the highest quality materials available, the Volcano Hybrid both looks and feels effortlessly luxurious. Its sleek digital display features a nifty control panel in addition to providing precise temperature readings throughout your entire session. Better still, all buttons featured are touchable as opposed to requiring a press, giving this vaporizer an instantly sophisticated yet modern twist.
Optimum Vapour Quality
Like its predecessors, one of the main focuses of the Volcano Hybrid is producing vapour of maximum quality & taste – and it certainly doesn’t disappoint! Its contemporary rotatable tube system allows you to decide precisely how much vapour you wish to take in, providing ultimate flexibility and control over your experience. Also included is the traditional Easy Valve balloon system which means multiple inhalation methods are available to you.
Convenient App Control
Volcano Hybrid also has an app compatible with both iOS & Android devices. All you need is a working Bluetooth connection and you’re good to go! The app allows you to easily adjust all the settings this vape offers without having to actually touch the vape itself which means you can control your entire session remotely just using your smartphone. It also allows you to set up workflows that control the temperature and the pumping for different timed intervals.
Note: As of 17th November 2019, Apple has restricted vaping apps on App Store, so unless you previously have a downloaded copy of the Storz & Bickel app you need to use a web browser to control the Volcano Hybrid from an iPhone.
Faster Heat-Up Time
Offering an even speedier heating time than previous models, the Volcano Hybrid can fully heat-up and be used within a mere 40 seconds. Its integrated double helix heat exchanger makes such quick heating possible and 100% safe, meaning you’ll never be left waiting feeling frustrated for your session to begin.
Warranty
All Volcano Hybrid vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is the Angus vaporizer for?
The Angus is an innovative vaporizer that features a halogen heating system and glass ball technology to provide a new kind of vaping experience. A halogen light bulb is used for heating air which then passes through glass balls into the chamber where it turns your herbs into vapour before reaching the glass mouthpiece at the top.
Whether you are an experienced user or a beginner, you will find that the Angus is easy to use and capable of producing tasty vapour in just 90 seconds. Its combination of unique heating technology and quality build make it a top choice for anyone looking for a portable premium vaporizer.
Innovative halogen heating system
The halogen heating system used in the Angus is a unique method for heating dry herbs to vaporization temperatures. Unlike other heating systems that use coils or ceramic elements, the Angus vaporizer utilizes a halogen light bulb as the heat source. This bulb, when powered on, emits heat and light, which is then absorbed by the glass balls beneath the chamber of herbs.
When you inhale, the heated air first passes through the glass balls and then the herbs to generate vapour. The combination of the convection heat from the halogen bulb and the radiation heat from the glass balls produces a vapour that is consistent and flavourful.
What sets the Halogen heating system apart from other heating methods is its unique flavour profile. The halogen bulb imparts a subtle flavour that is not as strong or noticeable as it is in other vaporizers and this allows users to taste the full and natural flavour of their herbs.
Easy temperature control
The Angus vape offers a range of temperature control options to help you get the perfect vaporization experience. With five temperature settings ranging from 180°C to 220°C, you can choose the temperature that works best for your herbs.
For those who want higher temperatures (up to 230°C), there is a boost mode that allows you to increase the temperature by 10°C with just the touch of a button. Simply hold the button down and the unit will vibrate once to indicate that the temperature has been boosted. This boost mode is perfect for when you want to get your herbs fully extracted.
Design and durability
The Angus vaporizer boasts a stunning walnut body that not only adds to its aesthetic appeal but also offers a comfortable grip. The body is crafted to last and its sturdy construction ensures that it can withstand daily use.
To further enhance its durability, the Angus has undergone rigorous drop testing and has proven to be able to survive multiple drops from a height of 1.5 meters with only replaceable parts, such as the glass mouthpiece, needing to be replaced.
Chamber size and microdosing
Even though the Angus vaporizer is compact it still has a spacious stainless steel herb chamber with a 0.25 g capacity that easily can be kept clean with the included tweezer.
With fully charged batteries, you can expect to vaporize approximately 2 g of your favourite herbs during 8 sessions if you fill the chamber every time. If you want to make reloading even quicker, use the included dosing capsules (2) to prepare ahead of time.
For those who prefer to microdose with their herbs, the Angus provides plenty of convection heating to do so without the need for any temperature adjustments. Simply put less herbs in the chamber and use it as normal for a lower dose experience.
Improved cooling system
The Angus vaporizer has been upgraded with a new cooling system, now featuring a stainless steel screen and a centrepiece made of high-quality stainless steel.
The cooling unit has also been improved with PEEK material, offering better durability and protection against melting. This updated design addresses the issues of lower-quality PPSU material used in the previous cooling unit, ensuring safer vaping.
Quick heat-up time
With an approximate 90-second initial pre-heat time, it is recommended to turn on the vaporizer and select your desired temperature before loading it to minimise wait times. Subsequent sessions will heat up faster due to the retained heat.
Powered by 18650 batteries
The Angus vaporizer is powered by two 18650 batteries. Depending on your usage and temperature setting, you can expect to get anywhere from 7-10 full sessions before the batteries need to be recharged. The exact number of sessions will depend on factors such as the frequency of use and the amount of heat retained between sessions.
Two powerful 18650 batteries (2800 mAh) from Molicel are included for free when you purchase your Angus from MagicVaporizers.
Adjustable airflow
With the Angus vaporizer, users can customize the airflow to their preferences. To adjust it, simply rotate the metal screen dial located in the mouthpiece.
5-minute sessions
Designed for use as a session vape, the Angus features a 5-minute shut-off timer. If you are short on time you can still get a great session with just a few large inhales on the max settings. Whether you prefer long sessions or going all in, the Angus delivers satisfying results.
Carry case included
The Angus also comes with a sleek and stylish carry case that makes it incredibly easy to transport your vaporizer wherever you go. The case is made of high-quality materials and provides ample protection against any potential damage. This carry case not only adds an extra level of convenience but also makes it easy to keep your vaporizer in a safe and secure place.
Can be upgraded
Want even cooler vapour? The Angus vaporizer has a water pipe adapter available for add-on purchase which can take your vaping experience to the next level. The adapter allows you to connect it to your favourite water tool (the adapter fits 18 mm and 14 mm female connections) to let the vapour be cooled down as it passes through water which makes it smoother and more comfortable to inhale.
How to use the Angus vaporizer
Even without a display, the Angus is still very easy to use:
Turn the Angus on by clicking the button three times.
Either fill the herb chamber before turning it on or fill it with your herb of choice now.
Wait for approximately 90 seconds for the Angus to heat up. The haptic feedback will vibrate when the set temperature is reached.
Enjoy the delicious vapour!
...or change the temperature by pressing the button to cycle through the five temperature settings: 180, 190, 200, 210, and 220°C.
Once the desired temperature is reached you can hold down the button for a 10°C degree temperature boost. The Angus will vibrate to indicate the temperature has been boosted.
Once you’re done, either click the button three times again or wait for the session timer to run out (5 minutes).

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries
£149
£199
Reduce temperature, increase humidity, maximize efficiency, and experience the finest vapour available with the Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries. You can use it with balloons (Easy Valve) and with the tube (if you have a Volcano Hybrid).
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler for Volcano vaporizers reduces the temperature of the vapour (up to 40°C less) while simultaneously adding humidity (over 93%+) to it which makes it much less harsh on your throat and lungs. Thanks to the lower temperature and increased humidity you can vaporize at temperatures higher than you normally would, without coughing, and you can, therefore, extract more of your herbs or concentrate.
You don't have to worry about water spills either as the Obsidian Glass Bubbler features a secondary water trap (not included on Magma Bubbler). This helps prevent getting moisture or liquid mixed in with your herbs or concentrates in the rare case of unintentional overfills or accidents.
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler is constructed from the highest quality grade borosilicate glass that is easy to clean with isopropyl alcohol. It is hand blown by master glass artisans to ensure a precision fit with your Easy Valve filling chamber for a perfect seal, every time.
Intended for use with: Volcano Digit, Volcano Classic UK and Volcano Hybrid UK.

Who is the Volcano Classic for?
The Volcano Classic vaporizer transformed the entire vaping scene when it was released – and it’s not hard to see why. Everything about this vape is quality and it’s a great choice for those serious about vaping and willing to invest in a truly outstanding, high-performance vaporizer.
It’s simple to operate and uses the iconic Volcano "Easy Valve" balloon system to ensure no quality vapour is lost. This vape has been the bestselling desktop vape for over two decades and it’s not hard to see why. There is only one better stationary vaporizer, and that’s the Volcano Hybrid which cost significantly more, so if you are looking for the best value for a Volcano vaporizer, the Classic is a very good option.
High Quality Throughout
The Volcano Classic was developed in and is still produced in Germany using the highest quality materials to ensure that the vapour produced will always be of the highest purity and that it will still be performing at the highest level year after year. The reputation it’s developed over the years is a mere glimpse into the remarkable quality the Volcano Classic offers, with reliability and longevity that hasn’t been matched by any other vaporizer.
Unique Technology
If you have tried vaping from a balloon system before you know how convenient it is, both for solo and group use, and it was the Volcano Classic that pioneered the use of balloons to hold vapour. It’s simple to use and ideal for both beginners and seasoned vapers alike, because once you’ve learnt how to utilize this mechanism, you’re guaranteed to achieve a first-rate vaping experience every single time.
As soon as you press the button to start the fan, the flavour-rich vapour from your chosen herbs, wax or oil, starts flowing into the balloon from the filling chamber. All vapour produced during your session will collect in the balloon and is easy to be inhaled once the balloon is detached – without experiencing any vapour loss.
Vapour can be stored in the balloon for up to an impressive 8 hours so you can inhale at your leisure which allows you to enjoy top quality, flavourful vapour independent of the session itself.
Simple Temperature Control
The Volcano Classic’s distinctive traditional design features an analogue control as opposed to digital. To control the temperature there is central dial that feature 9 temperature increments – each corresponding to a specific degree, perfect for those who prefer simplicity during their sessions. Decide which temperature that matches your herbs, from 130°C and 230°C, and check the Volcano Classic instruction manual to identify which number corresponds that temperature. It’s super easy to adjust the temperature and can be done in seconds buttons as the temperature control of this vape has been designed with convenience in mind.
Consistent and Reliable Temperature
Even though the Volcano Classic takes up to 3 minutes to fully heat-up, it’s definitely worth the wait. Once the desired temperature is reached the control light will go off, letting you know it’s ready to start producing vapour. After that it maintains the temperature throughout your entire session meaning you’ll never have to worry about your vape suddenly dipping in temperature and requiring to be heated-up once more.
Warranty
All Volcano Classic vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries

£149
Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries
£149
£199
Reduce temperature, increase humidity, maximize efficiency, and experience the finest vapour available with the Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries. You can use it with balloons (Easy Valve) and with the tube (if you have a Volcano Hybrid).
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler for Volcano vaporizers reduces the temperature of the vapour (up to 40°C less) while simultaneously adding humidity (over 93%+) to it which makes it much less harsh on your throat and lungs. Thanks to the lower temperature and increased humidity you can vaporize at temperatures higher than you normally would, without coughing, and you can, therefore, extract more of your herbs or concentrate.
You don't have to worry about water spills either as the Obsidian Glass Bubbler features a secondary water trap (not included on Magma Bubbler). This helps prevent getting moisture or liquid mixed in with your herbs or concentrates in the rare case of unintentional overfills or accidents.
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler is constructed from the highest quality grade borosilicate glass that is easy to clean with isopropyl alcohol. It is hand blown by master glass artisans to ensure a precision fit with your Easy Valve filling chamber for a perfect seal, every time.
Intended for use with: Volcano Digit, Volcano Classic UK and Volcano Hybrid UK.

Who is the Volcano Classic for?
The Volcano Classic vaporizer transformed the entire vaping scene when it was released – and it’s not hard to see why. Everything about this vape is quality and it’s a great choice for those serious about vaping and willing to invest in a truly outstanding, high-performance vaporizer.
It’s simple to operate and uses the iconic Volcano "Easy Valve" balloon system to ensure no quality vapour is lost. This vape has been the bestselling desktop vape for over two decades and it’s not hard to see why. There is only one better stationary vaporizer, and that’s the Volcano Hybrid which cost significantly more, so if you are looking for the best value for a Volcano vaporizer, the Classic is a very good option.
High Quality Throughout
The Volcano Classic was developed in and is still produced in Germany using the highest quality materials to ensure that the vapour produced will always be of the highest purity and that it will still be performing at the highest level year after year. The reputation it’s developed over the years is a mere glimpse into the remarkable quality the Volcano Classic offers, with reliability and longevity that hasn’t been matched by any other vaporizer.
Unique Technology
If you have tried vaping from a balloon system before you know how convenient it is, both for solo and group use, and it was the Volcano Classic that pioneered the use of balloons to hold vapour. It’s simple to use and ideal for both beginners and seasoned vapers alike, because once you’ve learnt how to utilize this mechanism, you’re guaranteed to achieve a first-rate vaping experience every single time.
As soon as you press the button to start the fan, the flavour-rich vapour from your chosen herbs, wax or oil, starts flowing into the balloon from the filling chamber. All vapour produced during your session will collect in the balloon and is easy to be inhaled once the balloon is detached – without experiencing any vapour loss.
Vapour can be stored in the balloon for up to an impressive 8 hours so you can inhale at your leisure which allows you to enjoy top quality, flavourful vapour independent of the session itself.
Simple Temperature Control
The Volcano Classic’s distinctive traditional design features an analogue control as opposed to digital. To control the temperature there is central dial that feature 9 temperature increments – each corresponding to a specific degree, perfect for those who prefer simplicity during their sessions. Decide which temperature that matches your herbs, from 130°C and 230°C, and check the Volcano Classic instruction manual to identify which number corresponds that temperature. It’s super easy to adjust the temperature and can be done in seconds buttons as the temperature control of this vape has been designed with convenience in mind.
Consistent and Reliable Temperature
Even though the Volcano Classic takes up to 3 minutes to fully heat-up, it’s definitely worth the wait. Once the desired temperature is reached the control light will go off, letting you know it’s ready to start producing vapour. After that it maintains the temperature throughout your entire session meaning you’ll never have to worry about your vape suddenly dipping in temperature and requiring to be heated-up once more.
Warranty
All Volcano Classic vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries
£149
£199
Reduce temperature, increase humidity, maximize efficiency, and experience the finest vapour available with the Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries. You can use it with balloons (Easy Valve) and with the tube (if you have a Volcano Hybrid).
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler for Volcano vaporizers reduces the temperature of the vapour (up to 40°C less) while simultaneously adding humidity (over 93%+) to it which makes it much less harsh on your throat and lungs. Thanks to the lower temperature and increased humidity you can vaporize at temperatures higher than you normally would, without coughing, and you can, therefore, extract more of your herbs or concentrate.
You don't have to worry about water spills either as the Obsidian Glass Bubbler features a secondary water trap (not included on Magma Bubbler). This helps prevent getting moisture or liquid mixed in with your herbs or concentrates in the rare case of unintentional overfills or accidents.
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler is constructed from the highest quality grade borosilicate glass that is easy to clean with isopropyl alcohol. It is hand blown by master glass artisans to ensure a precision fit with your Easy Valve filling chamber for a perfect seal, every time.
Intended for use with: Volcano Digit, Volcano Classic UK and Volcano Hybrid UK.

Who is the Volcano Classic for?
The Volcano Classic vaporizer transformed the entire vaping scene when it was released – and it’s not hard to see why. Everything about this vape is quality and it’s a great choice for those serious about vaping and willing to invest in a truly outstanding, high-performance vaporizer.
It’s simple to operate and uses the iconic Volcano "Easy Valve" balloon system to ensure no quality vapour is lost. This vape has been the bestselling desktop vape for over two decades and it’s not hard to see why. There is only one better stationary vaporizer, and that’s the Volcano Hybrid which cost significantly more, so if you are looking for the best value for a Volcano vaporizer, the Classic is a very good option.
High Quality Throughout
The Volcano Classic was developed in and is still produced in Germany using the highest quality materials to ensure that the vapour produced will always be of the highest purity and that it will still be performing at the highest level year after year. The reputation it’s developed over the years is a mere glimpse into the remarkable quality the Volcano Classic offers, with reliability and longevity that hasn’t been matched by any other vaporizer.
Unique Technology
If you have tried vaping from a balloon system before you know how convenient it is, both for solo and group use, and it was the Volcano Classic that pioneered the use of balloons to hold vapour. It’s simple to use and ideal for both beginners and seasoned vapers alike, because once you’ve learnt how to utilize this mechanism, you’re guaranteed to achieve a first-rate vaping experience every single time.
As soon as you press the button to start the fan, the flavour-rich vapour from your chosen herbs, wax or oil, starts flowing into the balloon from the filling chamber. All vapour produced during your session will collect in the balloon and is easy to be inhaled once the balloon is detached – without experiencing any vapour loss.
Vapour can be stored in the balloon for up to an impressive 8 hours so you can inhale at your leisure which allows you to enjoy top quality, flavourful vapour independent of the session itself.
Simple Temperature Control
The Volcano Classic’s distinctive traditional design features an analogue control as opposed to digital. To control the temperature there is central dial that feature 9 temperature increments – each corresponding to a specific degree, perfect for those who prefer simplicity during their sessions. Decide which temperature that matches your herbs, from 130°C and 230°C, and check the Volcano Classic instruction manual to identify which number corresponds that temperature. It’s super easy to adjust the temperature and can be done in seconds buttons as the temperature control of this vape has been designed with convenience in mind.
Consistent and Reliable Temperature
Even though the Volcano Classic takes up to 3 minutes to fully heat-up, it’s definitely worth the wait. Once the desired temperature is reached the control light will go off, letting you know it’s ready to start producing vapour. After that it maintains the temperature throughout your entire session meaning you’ll never have to worry about your vape suddenly dipping in temperature and requiring to be heated-up once more.
Warranty
All Volcano Classic vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries
£149
£199
Reduce temperature, increase humidity, maximize efficiency, and experience the finest vapour available with the Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries. You can use it with balloons (Easy Valve) and with the tube (if you have a Volcano Hybrid).
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler for Volcano vaporizers reduces the temperature of the vapour (up to 40°C less) while simultaneously adding humidity (over 93%+) to it which makes it much less harsh on your throat and lungs. Thanks to the lower temperature and increased humidity you can vaporize at temperatures higher than you normally would, without coughing, and you can, therefore, extract more of your herbs or concentrate.
You don't have to worry about water spills either as the Obsidian Glass Bubbler features a secondary water trap (not included on Magma Bubbler). This helps prevent getting moisture or liquid mixed in with your herbs or concentrates in the rare case of unintentional overfills or accidents.
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler is constructed from the highest quality grade borosilicate glass that is easy to clean with isopropyl alcohol. It is hand blown by master glass artisans to ensure a precision fit with your Easy Valve filling chamber for a perfect seal, every time.
Intended for use with: Volcano Digit, Volcano Classic UK and Volcano Hybrid UK.

Who is the Volcano Classic for?
The Volcano Classic vaporizer transformed the entire vaping scene when it was released – and it’s not hard to see why. Everything about this vape is quality and it’s a great choice for those serious about vaping and willing to invest in a truly outstanding, high-performance vaporizer.
It’s simple to operate and uses the iconic Volcano "Easy Valve" balloon system to ensure no quality vapour is lost. This vape has been the bestselling desktop vape for over two decades and it’s not hard to see why. There is only one better stationary vaporizer, and that’s the Volcano Hybrid which cost significantly more, so if you are looking for the best value for a Volcano vaporizer, the Classic is a very good option.
High Quality Throughout
The Volcano Classic was developed in and is still produced in Germany using the highest quality materials to ensure that the vapour produced will always be of the highest purity and that it will still be performing at the highest level year after year. The reputation it’s developed over the years is a mere glimpse into the remarkable quality the Volcano Classic offers, with reliability and longevity that hasn’t been matched by any other vaporizer.
Unique Technology
If you have tried vaping from a balloon system before you know how convenient it is, both for solo and group use, and it was the Volcano Classic that pioneered the use of balloons to hold vapour. It’s simple to use and ideal for both beginners and seasoned vapers alike, because once you’ve learnt how to utilize this mechanism, you’re guaranteed to achieve a first-rate vaping experience every single time.
As soon as you press the button to start the fan, the flavour-rich vapour from your chosen herbs, wax or oil, starts flowing into the balloon from the filling chamber. All vapour produced during your session will collect in the balloon and is easy to be inhaled once the balloon is detached – without experiencing any vapour loss.
Vapour can be stored in the balloon for up to an impressive 8 hours so you can inhale at your leisure which allows you to enjoy top quality, flavourful vapour independent of the session itself.
Simple Temperature Control
The Volcano Classic’s distinctive traditional design features an analogue control as opposed to digital. To control the temperature there is central dial that feature 9 temperature increments – each corresponding to a specific degree, perfect for those who prefer simplicity during their sessions. Decide which temperature that matches your herbs, from 130°C and 230°C, and check the Volcano Classic instruction manual to identify which number corresponds that temperature. It’s super easy to adjust the temperature and can be done in seconds buttons as the temperature control of this vape has been designed with convenience in mind.
Consistent and Reliable Temperature
Even though the Volcano Classic takes up to 3 minutes to fully heat-up, it’s definitely worth the wait. Once the desired temperature is reached the control light will go off, letting you know it’s ready to start producing vapour. After that it maintains the temperature throughout your entire session meaning you’ll never have to worry about your vape suddenly dipping in temperature and requiring to be heated-up once more.
Warranty
All Volcano Classic vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries
£149
£199
Reduce temperature, increase humidity, maximize efficiency, and experience the finest vapour available with the Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries. You can use it with balloons (Easy Valve) and with the tube (if you have a Volcano Hybrid).
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler for Volcano vaporizers reduces the temperature of the vapour (up to 40°C less) while simultaneously adding humidity (over 93%+) to it which makes it much less harsh on your throat and lungs. Thanks to the lower temperature and increased humidity you can vaporize at temperatures higher than you normally would, without coughing, and you can, therefore, extract more of your herbs or concentrate.
You don't have to worry about water spills either as the Obsidian Glass Bubbler features a secondary water trap (not included on Magma Bubbler). This helps prevent getting moisture or liquid mixed in with your herbs or concentrates in the rare case of unintentional overfills or accidents.
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler is constructed from the highest quality grade borosilicate glass that is easy to clean with isopropyl alcohol. It is hand blown by master glass artisans to ensure a precision fit with your Easy Valve filling chamber for a perfect seal, every time.
Intended for use with: Volcano Digit, Volcano Classic UK and Volcano Hybrid UK.

Who is the Volcano Classic for?
The Volcano Classic vaporizer transformed the entire vaping scene when it was released – and it’s not hard to see why. Everything about this vape is quality and it’s a great choice for those serious about vaping and willing to invest in a truly outstanding, high-performance vaporizer.
It’s simple to operate and uses the iconic Volcano "Easy Valve" balloon system to ensure no quality vapour is lost. This vape has been the bestselling desktop vape for over two decades and it’s not hard to see why. There is only one better stationary vaporizer, and that’s the Volcano Hybrid which cost significantly more, so if you are looking for the best value for a Volcano vaporizer, the Classic is a very good option.
High Quality Throughout
The Volcano Classic was developed in and is still produced in Germany using the highest quality materials to ensure that the vapour produced will always be of the highest purity and that it will still be performing at the highest level year after year. The reputation it’s developed over the years is a mere glimpse into the remarkable quality the Volcano Classic offers, with reliability and longevity that hasn’t been matched by any other vaporizer.
Unique Technology
If you have tried vaping from a balloon system before you know how convenient it is, both for solo and group use, and it was the Volcano Classic that pioneered the use of balloons to hold vapour. It’s simple to use and ideal for both beginners and seasoned vapers alike, because once you’ve learnt how to utilize this mechanism, you’re guaranteed to achieve a first-rate vaping experience every single time.
As soon as you press the button to start the fan, the flavour-rich vapour from your chosen herbs, wax or oil, starts flowing into the balloon from the filling chamber. All vapour produced during your session will collect in the balloon and is easy to be inhaled once the balloon is detached – without experiencing any vapour loss.
Vapour can be stored in the balloon for up to an impressive 8 hours so you can inhale at your leisure which allows you to enjoy top quality, flavourful vapour independent of the session itself.
Simple Temperature Control
The Volcano Classic’s distinctive traditional design features an analogue control as opposed to digital. To control the temperature there is central dial that feature 9 temperature increments – each corresponding to a specific degree, perfect for those who prefer simplicity during their sessions. Decide which temperature that matches your herbs, from 130°C and 230°C, and check the Volcano Classic instruction manual to identify which number corresponds that temperature. It’s super easy to adjust the temperature and can be done in seconds buttons as the temperature control of this vape has been designed with convenience in mind.
Consistent and Reliable Temperature
Even though the Volcano Classic takes up to 3 minutes to fully heat-up, it’s definitely worth the wait. Once the desired temperature is reached the control light will go off, letting you know it’s ready to start producing vapour. After that it maintains the temperature throughout your entire session meaning you’ll never have to worry about your vape suddenly dipping in temperature and requiring to be heated-up once more.
Warranty
All Volcano Classic vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries

Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries
£149
£199
Reduce temperature, increase humidity, maximize efficiency, and experience the finest vapour available with the Obsidian Glass Bubbler by Magma Industries. You can use it with balloons (Easy Valve) and with the tube (if you have a Volcano Hybrid).
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler for Volcano vaporizers reduces the temperature of the vapour (up to 40°C less) while simultaneously adding humidity (over 93%+) to it which makes it much less harsh on your throat and lungs. Thanks to the lower temperature and increased humidity you can vaporize at temperatures higher than you normally would, without coughing, and you can, therefore, extract more of your herbs or concentrate.
You don't have to worry about water spills either as the Obsidian Glass Bubbler features a secondary water trap (not included on Magma Bubbler). This helps prevent getting moisture or liquid mixed in with your herbs or concentrates in the rare case of unintentional overfills or accidents.
The Obsidian Glass Bubbler is constructed from the highest quality grade borosilicate glass that is easy to clean with isopropyl alcohol. It is hand blown by master glass artisans to ensure a precision fit with your Easy Valve filling chamber for a perfect seal, every time.
Intended for use with: Volcano Digit, Volcano Classic UK and Volcano Hybrid UK.

Who is the Volcano Classic for?
The Volcano Classic vaporizer transformed the entire vaping scene when it was released – and it’s not hard to see why. Everything about this vape is quality and it’s a great choice for those serious about vaping and willing to invest in a truly outstanding, high-performance vaporizer.
It’s simple to operate and uses the iconic Volcano "Easy Valve" balloon system to ensure no quality vapour is lost. This vape has been the bestselling desktop vape for over two decades and it’s not hard to see why. There is only one better stationary vaporizer, and that’s the Volcano Hybrid which cost significantly more, so if you are looking for the best value for a Volcano vaporizer, the Classic is a very good option.
High Quality Throughout
The Volcano Classic was developed in and is still produced in Germany using the highest quality materials to ensure that the vapour produced will always be of the highest purity and that it will still be performing at the highest level year after year. The reputation it’s developed over the years is a mere glimpse into the remarkable quality the Volcano Classic offers, with reliability and longevity that hasn’t been matched by any other vaporizer.
Unique Technology
If you have tried vaping from a balloon system before you know how convenient it is, both for solo and group use, and it was the Volcano Classic that pioneered the use of balloons to hold vapour. It’s simple to use and ideal for both beginners and seasoned vapers alike, because once you’ve learnt how to utilize this mechanism, you’re guaranteed to achieve a first-rate vaping experience every single time.
As soon as you press the button to start the fan, the flavour-rich vapour from your chosen herbs, wax or oil, starts flowing into the balloon from the filling chamber. All vapour produced during your session will collect in the balloon and is easy to be inhaled once the balloon is detached – without experiencing any vapour loss.
Vapour can be stored in the balloon for up to an impressive 8 hours so you can inhale at your leisure which allows you to enjoy top quality, flavourful vapour independent of the session itself.
Simple Temperature Control
The Volcano Classic’s distinctive traditional design features an analogue control as opposed to digital. To control the temperature there is central dial that feature 9 temperature increments – each corresponding to a specific degree, perfect for those who prefer simplicity during their sessions. Decide which temperature that matches your herbs, from 130°C and 230°C, and check the Volcano Classic instruction manual to identify which number corresponds that temperature. It’s super easy to adjust the temperature and can be done in seconds buttons as the temperature control of this vape has been designed with convenience in mind.
Consistent and Reliable Temperature
Even though the Volcano Classic takes up to 3 minutes to fully heat-up, it’s definitely worth the wait. Once the desired temperature is reached the control light will go off, letting you know it’s ready to start producing vapour. After that it maintains the temperature throughout your entire session meaning you’ll never have to worry about your vape suddenly dipping in temperature and requiring to be heated-up once more.
Warranty
All Volcano Classic vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is the XMax V3 Pro for?
XMax designed the V3 Pro for people who want a budget-friendly, lightweight vape that is highly portable and discreet. Thanks to the slim design it excels in portability which is perfect if you're outside a lot or just looking for something easy to handle in your hand or pocket.
XMax V3 Pro is also versatile as it can vaporize herbs as well as concentrate. The full convection heating combined with the fast heat-up time and easy-to-use interface, make this an excellent vape for most users.
On-demand convection vapour
New for this version of the XMax Pro is the on-demand mode. This mode only heats the herbs/concentrates for 30 seconds at a time. This reduces waste as you only heat the oven (0,15 g capacity) when you are using the vape. Though, if you prefer the oven to stay heated, you can always use the session mode instead (4 or 6 minutes).
As XMax V3 Pro is a convection vape, this means that the heat applied to the herbs/concentrates will be through hot air. This gives you a better flavour, more evenly vaped material, and more vapour when compared to conduction vapes that have direct contact with the material being vaped. After the vapour is produced, it’s then led through an isolated air path (no contact with electronics/metal) before reaching the mouthpiece.
Fast to heat up
With the XMax V3 Pro, you can select any temperature you want from 100 to 220°C, with a 1°C precision. If you enjoy smooth, flavourful vapour you should use the temperatures under 200°C, and if you want to get everything out from your herbs, with less flavour but more potency, you should heat it to the higher temperatures. You don’t have to wait long as it only takes 15 seconds to heat it up!
Pocket-friendly and discreet
Thanks to the compact size of the XMax V3 Pro, it's very pocket-friendly and lightweight making it easy to take with you outside. The discreet look of the unit makes it attractive for those who want a vape that they can quickly hide in their hand or bag when needed.
Not only for herbs
A wax cup is included with the XMax V3 Pro that you can use to vape concentrates such as waxes and oil. Simply add your concentrate to the cup, insert the cup into the vape, and then you are ready to vape. Note that when using concentrates in a vaporizer, you need to use higher temperatures than when vaping herbs.
Innovative mouthpiece
The magnetic mouthpiece is designed with a scraping tool to make cleaning and stirring easier. This heat-resistant plastic mouthpiece can be disassembled and deep cleaned, which helps prevent residue getting stuck.
Great battery
The XMax V3 Pro comes with a high-quality rechargeable, removable 18650 battery that allows you to vape for longer between charges. Each charge provides about 50 minutes of use. If you want to do longer sessions than that, or if you just want to avoid thinking about charging as often, we recommend buying an extra battery so that you can easily replace the discharged one with the charged one and continue.
USB-C charging
Another new thing with the V3 Pro is that it now has a USB-C charging port for ultra-fast charging. The battery is fully charged in about two hours from being completely discharged.
Quality construction
The XMax V3 Pro has an aluminium casing that ensures that it is comfortable to hold and does not get too hot. It also features a ceramic heating chamber for better taste, as well as having precise temperature control to allow you to experiment with different temperatures.
You can also find all relevant information such as set mode/temperature, current temperature, and battery status on the OLED display. The device itself measures only 2.7 × 2.4 × 15.0 cm in size so it will fit easily into all pockets or bags!
Easy to clean
To clean the XMax V3 Pro vaporizer after use just brush off the stainless-steel bowl and screens. If there is any residue left you can remove it with a cotton swab with some alcohol on it.
You can also remove the ceramic and stainless-steel vapour path to fully clean if residue gets stuck in it after using it for a long time.
What's the difference between XMax V2 Pro and V3 Pro?
The XMax V3 Pro is smaller than the original V2 and also has a smaller chamber but it is still enough for one session (0.15 g) so you do not have to think about reloading immediately. Another difference is the convection heating, which shortens the heating time by 80% and means that V3 Pro vape gets more of your herbs.
Warranty
All XMax V3 Pro vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of XMax, are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty on the device and a 6-month warranty on the battery.

Make charging easier and extend the longevity of your vaporizer by using this Magnetic USB-C Adapter. All you have to do is attach one part of the adapter to your vaporizer, and the other part of it to a USB-C cable. The two parts then connect easily through magnetic force and your vaporizer acts as if it was plugged in normally, but without any force of insertion needed (and it can be done with only one hand!).
The USB port is usually the most sensitive area for mechanical errors due to wear and tear, so by using this adapter you can ensure that your vaporizer will be better protected from any damage to the port.
This Magnetic USB-C Adapter is compatible with all types of vaporizers and can be used with any USB-C cable. It has a 120W / 5A capacity meaning that it's strong enough to even charge laptops.

Who is the XMax V3 Pro for?
XMax designed the V3 Pro for people who want a budget-friendly, lightweight vape that is highly portable and discreet. Thanks to the slim design it excels in portability which is perfect if you're outside a lot or just looking for something easy to handle in your hand or pocket.
XMax V3 Pro is also versatile as it can vaporize herbs as well as concentrate. The full convection heating combined with the fast heat-up time and easy-to-use interface, make this an excellent vape for most users.
On-demand convection vapour
New for this version of the XMax Pro is the on-demand mode. This mode only heats the herbs/concentrates for 30 seconds at a time. This reduces waste as you only heat the oven (0,15 g capacity) when you are using the vape. Though, if you prefer the oven to stay heated, you can always use the session mode instead (4 or 6 minutes).
As XMax V3 Pro is a convection vape, this means that the heat applied to the herbs/concentrates will be through hot air. This gives you a better flavour, more evenly vaped material, and more vapour when compared to conduction vapes that have direct contact with the material being vaped. After the vapour is produced, it’s then led through an isolated air path (no contact with electronics/metal) before reaching the mouthpiece.
Fast to heat up
With the XMax V3 Pro, you can select any temperature you want from 100 to 220°C, with a 1°C precision. If you enjoy smooth, flavourful vapour you should use the temperatures under 200°C, and if you want to get everything out from your herbs, with less flavour but more potency, you should heat it to the higher temperatures. You don’t have to wait long as it only takes 15 seconds to heat it up!
Pocket-friendly and discreet
Thanks to the compact size of the XMax V3 Pro, it's very pocket-friendly and lightweight making it easy to take with you outside. The discreet look of the unit makes it attractive for those who want a vape that they can quickly hide in their hand or bag when needed.
Not only for herbs
A wax cup is included with the XMax V3 Pro that you can use to vape concentrates such as waxes and oil. Simply add your concentrate to the cup, insert the cup into the vape, and then you are ready to vape. Note that when using concentrates in a vaporizer, you need to use higher temperatures than when vaping herbs.
Innovative mouthpiece
The magnetic mouthpiece is designed with a scraping tool to make cleaning and stirring easier. This heat-resistant plastic mouthpiece can be disassembled and deep cleaned, which helps prevent residue getting stuck.
Great battery
The XMax V3 Pro comes with a high-quality rechargeable, removable 18650 battery that allows you to vape for longer between charges. Each charge provides about 50 minutes of use. If you want to do longer sessions than that, or if you just want to avoid thinking about charging as often, we recommend buying an extra battery so that you can easily replace the discharged one with the charged one and continue.
USB-C charging
Another new thing with the V3 Pro is that it now has a USB-C charging port for ultra-fast charging. The battery is fully charged in about two hours from being completely discharged.
Quality construction
The XMax V3 Pro has an aluminium casing that ensures that it is comfortable to hold and does not get too hot. It also features a ceramic heating chamber for better taste, as well as having precise temperature control to allow you to experiment with different temperatures.
You can also find all relevant information such as set mode/temperature, current temperature, and battery status on the OLED display. The device itself measures only 2.7 × 2.4 × 15.0 cm in size so it will fit easily into all pockets or bags!
Easy to clean
To clean the XMax V3 Pro vaporizer after use just brush off the stainless-steel bowl and screens. If there is any residue left you can remove it with a cotton swab with some alcohol on it.
You can also remove the ceramic and stainless-steel vapour path to fully clean if residue gets stuck in it after using it for a long time.
What's the difference between XMax V2 Pro and V3 Pro?
The XMax V3 Pro is smaller than the original V2 and also has a smaller chamber but it is still enough for one session (0.15 g) so you do not have to think about reloading immediately. Another difference is the convection heating, which shortens the heating time by 80% and means that V3 Pro vape gets more of your herbs.
Warranty
All XMax V3 Pro vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of XMax, are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty on the device and a 6-month warranty on the battery.

Make charging easier and extend the longevity of your vaporizer by using this Magnetic USB-C Adapter. All you have to do is attach one part of the adapter to your vaporizer, and the other part of it to a USB-C cable. The two parts then connect easily through magnetic force and your vaporizer acts as if it was plugged in normally, but without any force of insertion needed (and it can be done with only one hand!).
The USB port is usually the most sensitive area for mechanical errors due to wear and tear, so by using this adapter you can ensure that your vaporizer will be better protected from any damage to the port.
This Magnetic USB-C Adapter is compatible with all types of vaporizers and can be used with any USB-C cable. It has a 120W / 5A capacity meaning that it's strong enough to even charge laptops.

Who is the XMax V3 Pro for?
XMax designed the V3 Pro for people who want a budget-friendly, lightweight vape that is highly portable and discreet. Thanks to the slim design it excels in portability which is perfect if you're outside a lot or just looking for something easy to handle in your hand or pocket.
XMax V3 Pro is also versatile as it can vaporize herbs as well as concentrate. The full convection heating combined with the fast heat-up time and easy-to-use interface, make this an excellent vape for most users.
On-demand convection vapour
New for this version of the XMax Pro is the on-demand mode. This mode only heats the herbs/concentrates for 30 seconds at a time. This reduces waste as you only heat the oven (0,15 g capacity) when you are using the vape. Though, if you prefer the oven to stay heated, you can always use the session mode instead (4 or 6 minutes).
As XMax V3 Pro is a convection vape, this means that the heat applied to the herbs/concentrates will be through hot air. This gives you a better flavour, more evenly vaped material, and more vapour when compared to conduction vapes that have direct contact with the material being vaped. After the vapour is produced, it’s then led through an isolated air path (no contact with electronics/metal) before reaching the mouthpiece.
Fast to heat up
With the XMax V3 Pro, you can select any temperature you want from 100 to 220°C, with a 1°C precision. If you enjoy smooth, flavourful vapour you should use the temperatures under 200°C, and if you want to get everything out from your herbs, with less flavour but more potency, you should heat it to the higher temperatures. You don’t have to wait long as it only takes 15 seconds to heat it up!
Pocket-friendly and discreet
Thanks to the compact size of the XMax V3 Pro, it's very pocket-friendly and lightweight making it easy to take with you outside. The discreet look of the unit makes it attractive for those who want a vape that they can quickly hide in their hand or bag when needed.
Not only for herbs
A wax cup is included with the XMax V3 Pro that you can use to vape concentrates such as waxes and oil. Simply add your concentrate to the cup, insert the cup into the vape, and then you are ready to vape. Note that when using concentrates in a vaporizer, you need to use higher temperatures than when vaping herbs.
Innovative mouthpiece
The magnetic mouthpiece is designed with a scraping tool to make cleaning and stirring easier. This heat-resistant plastic mouthpiece can be disassembled and deep cleaned, which helps prevent residue getting stuck.
Great battery
The XMax V3 Pro comes with a high-quality rechargeable, removable 18650 battery that allows you to vape for longer between charges. Each charge provides about 50 minutes of use. If you want to do longer sessions than that, or if you just want to avoid thinking about charging as often, we recommend buying an extra battery so that you can easily replace the discharged one with the charged one and continue.
USB-C charging
Another new thing with the V3 Pro is that it now has a USB-C charging port for ultra-fast charging. The battery is fully charged in about two hours from being completely discharged.
Quality construction
The XMax V3 Pro has an aluminium casing that ensures that it is comfortable to hold and does not get too hot. It also features a ceramic heating chamber for better taste, as well as having precise temperature control to allow you to experiment with different temperatures.
You can also find all relevant information such as set mode/temperature, current temperature, and battery status on the OLED display. The device itself measures only 2.7 × 2.4 × 15.0 cm in size so it will fit easily into all pockets or bags!
Easy to clean
To clean the XMax V3 Pro vaporizer after use just brush off the stainless-steel bowl and screens. If there is any residue left you can remove it with a cotton swab with some alcohol on it.
You can also remove the ceramic and stainless-steel vapour path to fully clean if residue gets stuck in it after using it for a long time.
What's the difference between XMax V2 Pro and V3 Pro?
The XMax V3 Pro is smaller than the original V2 and also has a smaller chamber but it is still enough for one session (0.15 g) so you do not have to think about reloading immediately. Another difference is the convection heating, which shortens the heating time by 80% and means that V3 Pro vape gets more of your herbs.
Warranty
All XMax V3 Pro vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of XMax, are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty on the device and a 6-month warranty on the battery.

Make charging easier and extend the longevity of your vaporizer by using this Magnetic USB-C Adapter. All you have to do is attach one part of the adapter to your vaporizer, and the other part of it to a USB-C cable. The two parts then connect easily through magnetic force and your vaporizer acts as if it was plugged in normally, but without any force of insertion needed (and it can be done with only one hand!).
The USB port is usually the most sensitive area for mechanical errors due to wear and tear, so by using this adapter you can ensure that your vaporizer will be better protected from any damage to the port.
This Magnetic USB-C Adapter is compatible with all types of vaporizers and can be used with any USB-C cable. It has a 120W / 5A capacity meaning that it's strong enough to even charge laptops.

Who is the XMax V3 Pro for?
XMax designed the V3 Pro for people who want a budget-friendly, lightweight vape that is highly portable and discreet. Thanks to the slim design it excels in portability which is perfect if you're outside a lot or just looking for something easy to handle in your hand or pocket.
XMax V3 Pro is also versatile as it can vaporize herbs as well as concentrate. The full convection heating combined with the fast heat-up time and easy-to-use interface, make this an excellent vape for most users.
On-demand convection vapour
New for this version of the XMax Pro is the on-demand mode. This mode only heats the herbs/concentrates for 30 seconds at a time. This reduces waste as you only heat the oven (0,15 g capacity) when you are using the vape. Though, if you prefer the oven to stay heated, you can always use the session mode instead (4 or 6 minutes).
As XMax V3 Pro is a convection vape, this means that the heat applied to the herbs/concentrates will be through hot air. This gives you a better flavour, more evenly vaped material, and more vapour when compared to conduction vapes that have direct contact with the material being vaped. After the vapour is produced, it’s then led through an isolated air path (no contact with electronics/metal) before reaching the mouthpiece.
Fast to heat up
With the XMax V3 Pro, you can select any temperature you want from 100 to 220°C, with a 1°C precision. If you enjoy smooth, flavourful vapour you should use the temperatures under 200°C, and if you want to get everything out from your herbs, with less flavour but more potency, you should heat it to the higher temperatures. You don’t have to wait long as it only takes 15 seconds to heat it up!
Pocket-friendly and discreet
Thanks to the compact size of the XMax V3 Pro, it's very pocket-friendly and lightweight making it easy to take with you outside. The discreet look of the unit makes it attractive for those who want a vape that they can quickly hide in their hand or bag when needed.
Not only for herbs
A wax cup is included with the XMax V3 Pro that you can use to vape concentrates such as waxes and oil. Simply add your concentrate to the cup, insert the cup into the vape, and then you are ready to vape. Note that when using concentrates in a vaporizer, you need to use higher temperatures than when vaping herbs.
Innovative mouthpiece
The magnetic mouthpiece is designed with a scraping tool to make cleaning and stirring easier. This heat-resistant plastic mouthpiece can be disassembled and deep cleaned, which helps prevent residue getting stuck.
Great battery
The XMax V3 Pro comes with a high-quality rechargeable, removable 18650 battery that allows you to vape for longer between charges. Each charge provides about 50 minutes of use. If you want to do longer sessions than that, or if you just want to avoid thinking about charging as often, we recommend buying an extra battery so that you can easily replace the discharged one with the charged one and continue.
USB-C charging
Another new thing with the V3 Pro is that it now has a USB-C charging port for ultra-fast charging. The battery is fully charged in about two hours from being completely discharged.
Quality construction
The XMax V3 Pro has an aluminium casing that ensures that it is comfortable to hold and does not get too hot. It also features a ceramic heating chamber for better taste, as well as having precise temperature control to allow you to experiment with different temperatures.
You can also find all relevant information such as set mode/temperature, current temperature, and battery status on the OLED display. The device itself measures only 2.7 × 2.4 × 15.0 cm in size so it will fit easily into all pockets or bags!
Easy to clean
To clean the XMax V3 Pro vaporizer after use just brush off the stainless-steel bowl and screens. If there is any residue left you can remove it with a cotton swab with some alcohol on it.
You can also remove the ceramic and stainless-steel vapour path to fully clean if residue gets stuck in it after using it for a long time.
What's the difference between XMax V2 Pro and V3 Pro?
The XMax V3 Pro is smaller than the original V2 and also has a smaller chamber but it is still enough for one session (0.15 g) so you do not have to think about reloading immediately. Another difference is the convection heating, which shortens the heating time by 80% and means that V3 Pro vape gets more of your herbs.
Warranty
All XMax V3 Pro vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of XMax, are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty on the device and a 6-month warranty on the battery.

Make charging easier and extend the longevity of your vaporizer by using this Magnetic USB-C Adapter. All you have to do is attach one part of the adapter to your vaporizer, and the other part of it to a USB-C cable. The two parts then connect easily through magnetic force and your vaporizer acts as if it was plugged in normally, but without any force of insertion needed (and it can be done with only one hand!).
The USB port is usually the most sensitive area for mechanical errors due to wear and tear, so by using this adapter you can ensure that your vaporizer will be better protected from any damage to the port.
This Magnetic USB-C Adapter is compatible with all types of vaporizers and can be used with any USB-C cable. It has a 120W / 5A capacity meaning that it's strong enough to even charge laptops.

It includes a large collapsible silicone bowl that, when expanded, provides a spill-safe area for weighing your material and when the bowl is collapsed it can be latched with a lid to keep the scale safe from knocks.
The results are easy to read from the extra-large LCD with pink backlight and the built-in overload protection helps prevent damage to the scale. Other features include automatic piece counting, power-saving auto-off after 3 minutes of inactivity, tare/zero feature for subtracting the weight of a container or expansion tray, and easy one-touch calibration.

Who is the XMax V3 Pro for?
XMax designed the V3 Pro for people who want a budget-friendly, lightweight vape that is highly portable and discreet. Thanks to the slim design it excels in portability which is perfect if you're outside a lot or just looking for something easy to handle in your hand or pocket.
XMax V3 Pro is also versatile as it can vaporize herbs as well as concentrate. The full convection heating combined with the fast heat-up time and easy-to-use interface, make this an excellent vape for most users.
On-demand convection vapour
New for this version of the XMax Pro is the on-demand mode. This mode only heats the herbs/concentrates for 30 seconds at a time. This reduces waste as you only heat the oven (0,15 g capacity) when you are using the vape. Though, if you prefer the oven to stay heated, you can always use the session mode instead (4 or 6 minutes).
As XMax V3 Pro is a convection vape, this means that the heat applied to the herbs/concentrates will be through hot air. This gives you a better flavour, more evenly vaped material, and more vapour when compared to conduction vapes that have direct contact with the material being vaped. After the vapour is produced, it’s then led through an isolated air path (no contact with electronics/metal) before reaching the mouthpiece.
Fast to heat up
With the XMax V3 Pro, you can select any temperature you want from 100 to 220°C, with a 1°C precision. If you enjoy smooth, flavourful vapour you should use the temperatures under 200°C, and if you want to get everything out from your herbs, with less flavour but more potency, you should heat it to the higher temperatures. You don’t have to wait long as it only takes 15 seconds to heat it up!
Pocket-friendly and discreet
Thanks to the compact size of the XMax V3 Pro, it's very pocket-friendly and lightweight making it easy to take with you outside. The discreet look of the unit makes it attractive for those who want a vape that they can quickly hide in their hand or bag when needed.
Not only for herbs
A wax cup is included with the XMax V3 Pro that you can use to vape concentrates such as waxes and oil. Simply add your concentrate to the cup, insert the cup into the vape, and then you are ready to vape. Note that when using concentrates in a vaporizer, you need to use higher temperatures than when vaping herbs.
Innovative mouthpiece
The magnetic mouthpiece is designed with a scraping tool to make cleaning and stirring easier. This heat-resistant plastic mouthpiece can be disassembled and deep cleaned, which helps prevent residue getting stuck.
Great battery
The XMax V3 Pro comes with a high-quality rechargeable, removable 18650 battery that allows you to vape for longer between charges. Each charge provides about 50 minutes of use. If you want to do longer sessions than that, or if you just want to avoid thinking about charging as often, we recommend buying an extra battery so that you can easily replace the discharged one with the charged one and continue.
USB-C charging
Another new thing with the V3 Pro is that it now has a USB-C charging port for ultra-fast charging. The battery is fully charged in about two hours from being completely discharged.
Quality construction
The XMax V3 Pro has an aluminium casing that ensures that it is comfortable to hold and does not get too hot. It also features a ceramic heating chamber for better taste, as well as having precise temperature control to allow you to experiment with different temperatures.
You can also find all relevant information such as set mode/temperature, current temperature, and battery status on the OLED display. The device itself measures only 2.7 × 2.4 × 15.0 cm in size so it will fit easily into all pockets or bags!
Easy to clean
To clean the XMax V3 Pro vaporizer after use just brush off the stainless-steel bowl and screens. If there is any residue left you can remove it with a cotton swab with some alcohol on it.
You can also remove the ceramic and stainless-steel vapour path to fully clean if residue gets stuck in it after using it for a long time.
What's the difference between XMax V2 Pro and V3 Pro?
The XMax V3 Pro is smaller than the original V2 and also has a smaller chamber but it is still enough for one session (0.15 g) so you do not have to think about reloading immediately. Another difference is the convection heating, which shortens the heating time by 80% and means that V3 Pro vape gets more of your herbs.
Warranty
All XMax V3 Pro vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of XMax, are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty on the device and a 6-month warranty on the battery.

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)
£89
£119
Features
Induction heating
Great at heating DynaVap vaporizers
Full temperature control (120°C to 425°C)
Borosilicate glass cups
Removable batteries (2 × 2900 mAh)
Safety features
The Wand by Ispire is a portable induction heater for use with concentrates, and in addition to that, it’s also great at heating the tips of DynaVap vaporizers.
What is induction heat?
Induction heat is a highly accurate, controllable, and more predictable heat source than the torches used normally used for this kind of vaping, so you’re going to experience consistency and less waste by eliminating over- or under-heating. Select any temperature you want in 5-degree increments, from 120°C to 425°C.
Wand Glass Adapter for DynaVap vaporizers
If you plan on using the Wand with a DynaVap vaporizer, we recommend getting the Wand Glass Adapter so you can lodge the tip instead of having to swirl it around for even heat. With it, you no longer need to keep an eye on it and can use it hands-free. Just sit back and wait for the “click” of the Captive Cap.
Automatic and manual mode
You can use it in one of two modes, either manual mode or automatic mode. To use it in manual mode, hold the large button down until the cup or your DynaVap reaches your set temperature.
When you first hold the button down the Wand will blink with a red light, then once you put over something metal it will engage the induction heating and pulse a white light while it’s heating up. When it arrives at your set temperature the white light will stay on, meaning you can go ahead and enjoy whatever you're heating.
To use it in automatic mode, double press the large button, and then place it on the induction cup or put your DynaVap in it. One great thing about the automatic mode is that you can take it off and on throughout the cycle and it will just re-engage the heating, so you can sort of feather the heat while in use.
Removable batteries
The Wand is powered by two replaceable 2900 mAh batteries that can be charged with the included USB-C cable, or externally if you have a charger for 18650 batteries.

Duality Torch

The Duality is a high-quality butane torch lighter. It has a pocket-proof ignition and a single or double flame to choose from depending on your preference. It also features a large tank window that allows you to keep an eye on the fuel level, as well as making it easy to refill it without issue. The flame can be adjusted with the dial at the bottom and the flint ignition can be replaced if it gets worn out.
It ships empty so you need to add butane gas to it before you can use it.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Intended for use with: DynaVap B, DynaVap M, DynaVap M+ (Plus), DynaVap Omni and DynaVap VonG (i): Titanium.

Cyclone Triple Torch

The Vertigo Cyclone Triple Torch is one of the most budget friendly torch lighters you will ever find. It features a large, clear fuel tank so you’ll always know how much fuel remains and it also makes refilling it a lot easier. The wind resistant flame is capable of lighting at 3'500 meters above sea level.
Fill it with filtered butane gas, available at hobby stores and Amazon, before use (not included). We recommend using the brand Colibri but any butane gas that has been filtered at least five times should work well.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Do not clean the Cyclone Triple Torch with alcohol as this will degrade the plastic, resulting in fuel leaks.

DynaVap M+ (Plus) Features
Newest version (2023.07)
New finless design
One-heat-cycle extractions
Expanded oven capacity
Ready for microdosing
Manually heated
Who is the DynaVap M+ for?
The DynaVap M+ is designed for both new and experienced users that wants the latest advancements in manually heated dry herb vaporizers. Its innovative design allows for more efficient and satisfying extractions with less effort, making it an excellent choice for those who want to take full control of their vaping sessions.
New finless design for enhanced performance
With a finless design, the DynaVap M+ has increased mass at the base for improved heat absorption and retention, resulting in fuller extractions.
Heat the Captive Cap for a familiar experience or follow DynaVap's advice and heat the base for an intense, deep extraction. Open the air-port on the side and experience a DynaVap session like never before.
One-heat-cycle extractions
The DynaVap M+ tip is thermally optimised for one-heat-cycle extractions, allowing you to vape an entire bowl with a single heat-up. This feature sets the M+ apart from other DynaVap models and offers a unique, efficient vaping experience.
Expanded oven capacity
You can now enjoy more herbs in one go with the DynaVap M+ as it features an oven chamber that is 12% larger than previous M models for an even more powerful experience.
Stylish design updates
The DynaVap M+ boasts a square air-port and a sleek, edgy striped finish on its body that both look visually appealing and make for a comfortable grip.
Take control with manual heating
To heat the DynaVap M+, a torch lighter is the most popular way and as it lets you fully control the heating. Aim the torch on the M+ depending on how you want to vaporize and then listen for the ‘click' that signals when it’s the optimal time to inhale.
Ready for microdosing
The DynaVap M+ allows you to easily reduce the bowl size by half (from 0,1 g to 0,05 g) for smaller loads by simply removing the tip and adjust the screen to the next slot.
Flavourful and potent vapour
Whether you prefer light, tasty vapour or thick, dense clouds, the M+ delivers. Heat near the top for a delicate flavour or closer to the bottom for powerful, full extractions.
Improved o-ring design
The DynaVap M+ tip now uses two silicone O-rings instead of three, and none are visible when the tip is installed. This update reduces metal-to-metal contact and makes the unit even more durable.
Upgrade to induction heaters
If you appreciate DynaVap but prefer not to use a torch lighter, consider an induction heater such as the Ispire Wand. While larger than a torch lighter, induction heaters offer unmatched convenience and consistency. Simply insert the tip and let the heater take care of the rest.
Warranty
All DynaVap M+ vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DynaVap products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Features
Newest version! (2023.07)
Closed convection heating system
Premium glass mouthpiece
Charged via USB in under 2 hours
Compact & portable
Easy to use
Who is the Smono 3 for?
Smono 3 is handy and impressively compact, measuring-in at just 5 × 2,7 × 8 cm which makes it the ideal choice if you value convenience and love taking your vaporizer on-the-go – without feeling forced to take up too much storage space in your pocket or bag. Thanks to the simple design, the Smono 3 provides the perfect balance of lightweight style and ease of use.
Innovative Heating System
Unlike other vaporizers on the market that directly heat the herb itself via conduction, the Smono 3 takes a more elegant approach. Its advanced convection heating mechanism effortlessly pumps heated air directly through the herbs to create instant heat without damaging the material’s texture or taste. The produced vapour is therefore soft, dense and tasty – everything you could wish for!
Simple to Use
Smono 3 is free of complex buttons and remotes and has only 3 easy buttons. Since it's designed with utmost simplicity in mind this vape is perfect for newcomers to the vaping scene with little experience. A handy OLED display shows all vital details (set temperature, current temperature and power left in battery) meaning you can accurately control the Smono 3’s temperature without navigating any menus.
This vaporizer also boasts an automatic switch-off function to maintain optimum safety. Its integrated timer will instantly turn off the device after 4 minutes of inactivity to minimise the risk of accidents should you inadvertently fall asleep or get distracted.
Strong battery
Smono 3 has a built-in 1600 mAh battery that is charged via USB-cable. It goes from a depleted to a fully charged battery in 2 hours. A fully charged battery will give you about 45 minutes of runtime, meaning you can do plenty of sessions when you are out on adventures.
Premium Mouthpiece
The top-quality glass mouthpiece with a built-in glass cylinder ensures that the vapour is pure and cooled down to a good temperature before reaching you. The mouthpiece can also easily be detached from the device and taken apart for quick cleaning.
Warranty
The Smono 3 comes with a ten-year manufacturer's warranty, restricted to normal use.

Compact & portable
Easy to use
Who is the Smono 3 for?
Smono 3 is handy and impressively compact, measuring-in at just 5 × 2,7 × 8 cm which makes it the ideal choice if you value convenience and love taking your vaporizer on-the-go – without feeling forced to take up too much storage space in your pocket or bag. Thanks to the simple design, the Smono 3 provides the perfect balance of lightweight style and ease of use.
Innovative Heating System
Unlike other vaporizers on the market that directly heat the herb itself via conduction, the Smono 3 takes a more elegant approach. Its advanced convection heating mechanism effortlessly pumps heated air directly through the herbs to create instant heat without damaging the material’s texture or taste. The produced vapour is therefore soft, dense and tasty – everything you could wish for!
Simple to Use
Smono 3 is free of complex buttons and remotes and has only 3 easy buttons. Since it's designed with utmost simplicity in mind this vape is perfect for newcomers to the vaping scene with little experience. A handy OLED display shows all vital details (set temperature, current temperature and power left in battery) meaning you can accurately control the Smono 3’s temperature without navigating any menus.
This vaporizer also boasts an automatic switch-off function to maintain optimum safety. Its integrated timer will instantly turn off the device after 4 minutes of inactivity to minimise the risk of accidents should you inadvertently fall asleep or get distracted.
Strong battery
Smono 3 has a built-in 1600 mAh battery that is charged via USB-cable. It goes from a depleted to a fully charged battery in 2 hours. A fully charged battery will give you about 45 minutes of runtime, meaning you can do plenty of sessions when you are out on adventures.
Premium Mouthpiece
The top-quality glass mouthpiece with a built-in glass cylinder ensures that the vapour is pure and cooled down to a good temperature before reaching you. The mouthpiece can also easily be detached from the device and taken apart for quick cleaning.
Warranty
The Smono 3 comes with a ten-year manufacturer's warranty, restricted to normal use.

Features
Newest version! (2023.07)
Closed convection heating system
Premium glass mouthpiece
Charged via USB in under 2 hours
Compact & portable
Easy to use
Who is the Smono 3 for?
Smono 3 is handy and impressively compact, measuring-in at just 5 × 2,7 × 8 cm which makes it the ideal choice if you value convenience and love taking your vaporizer on-the-go – without feeling forced to take up too much storage space in your pocket or bag. Thanks to the simple design, the Smono 3 provides the perfect balance of lightweight style and ease of use.
Innovative Heating System
Unlike other vaporizers on the market that directly heat the herb itself via conduction, the Smono 3 takes a more elegant approach. Its advanced convection heating mechanism effortlessly pumps heated air directly through the herbs to create instant heat without damaging the material’s texture or taste. The produced vapour is therefore soft, dense and tasty – everything you could wish for!
Simple to Use
Smono 3 is free of complex buttons and remotes and has only 3 easy buttons. Since it's designed with utmost simplicity in mind this vape is perfect for newcomers to the vaping scene with little experience. A handy OLED display shows all vital details (set temperature, current temperature and power left in battery) meaning you can accurately control the Smono 3’s temperature without navigating any menus.
This vaporizer also boasts an automatic switch-off function to maintain optimum safety. Its integrated timer will instantly turn off the device after 4 minutes of inactivity to minimise the risk of accidents should you inadvertently fall asleep or get distracted.
Strong battery
Smono 3 has a built-in 1600 mAh battery that is charged via USB-cable. It goes from a depleted to a fully charged battery in 2 hours. A fully charged battery will give you about 45 minutes of runtime, meaning you can do plenty of sessions when you are out on adventures.
Premium Mouthpiece
The top-quality glass mouthpiece with a built-in glass cylinder ensures that the vapour is pure and cooled down to a good temperature before reaching you. The mouthpiece can also easily be detached from the device and taken apart for quick cleaning.
Warranty
The Smono 3 comes with a ten-year manufacturer's warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is XMax Starry V3 for?
The XMax Starry V3 is the perfect portable vaporizer for those looking to save money while still getting a quality product. It boasts features such as digital display, wide temperature range, swappable battery and haptic feedback (new for this version) that you won't find on other units at twice its price.
The sleek design makes it perfect for anyone looking to discreetly vape their favourite herbs without drawing too much attention from others when they are out exploring new horizons; and as the battery is swappable it's possible to carry an extra one or two for those long trips!
High-quality build
To find an affordable vape with high quality that is functional and aesthetically pleasing to the eye can seem like an impossible task. The XMax Starry V3 has been created with you in mind! With an outer case of aluminium and a ceramic zirconia mouthpiece, this stealthy vaporizer stands out from the sea of plastic vapes on the market at this price point.
Swappable battery
The XMax Starry V3 vaporizer is powered by a single 18650 type battery with a capacity of 2600 mAh that can be easily swapped out, giving it the ability to last much longer than an ordinary vape with a built-in battery.
With replaceable batteries, you can always have a new battery to replace when your current one is discharged. Perfect if you are away from home for a long time or if you just want to avoid thinking about charging batteries for a while.
Adjustable temperature and wide temperature range
The reliable ceramic oven in the Starry V3 can heat up to any temperature between 100°C and 240°C and is very fast at doing it so! Heating it to 200°C only takes 25 seconds and heating it to max temp (240°C) takes around 35 seconds.
Excellent vapour quality
XMax is well known for crafting reliable devices that produces good tasting vapour without costing too much. Like their other vapes, the XMax Starry V3 is using a ceramic conduction oven which holds up to 0.5 grams of herb and produces potent vapour quickly.
Your herbs or concentrate will never touch anything but clean materials like stainless steel and high-quality ceramic – ensuring that the vapour stays pure and full of flavours.
Easy to use
The Starry V3 is one of the most intuitive devices on the market. You can control three features with just a few buttons: turn it on/off, adjust temperature and set session time. Plus, there's also an OLED display to show you battery life as well as temperature readings so no more guessing! And if that wasn't enough for you, this device will vibrate gently when vaping the desired temperature has been reached.
The bevelled oven ring makes loading easy, and the magnetic mouthpiece won't get lost while filling it. With a ceramic zirconia mouthpiece that is strong and super smooth for comfortable use, you'll be able to preserve taste with every draw!
Ready for concentrates
The XMax Starry V3 is capable of vaporizing both herbs and concentrates with ease. The vape has a special concentrate pad designed for wax or oil vaping, making it perfect for those who like to mix their habits up from time-to-time.
Warranty
All XMax Starry V3 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of XMax, are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty on the device and a 6-month warranty on the battery.

Who is XMax Starry V3 for?
The XMax Starry V3 is the perfect portable vaporizer for those looking to save money while still getting a quality product. It boasts features such as digital display, wide temperature range, swappable battery and haptic feedback (new for this version) that you won't find on other units at twice its price.
The sleek design makes it perfect for anyone looking to discreetly vape their favourite herbs without drawing too much attention from others when they are out exploring new horizons; and as the battery is swappable it's possible to carry an extra one or two for those long trips!
High-quality build
To find an affordable vape with high quality that is functional and aesthetically pleasing to the eye can seem like an impossible task. The XMax Starry V3 has been created with you in mind! With an outer case of aluminium and a ceramic zirconia mouthpiece, this stealthy vaporizer stands out from the sea of plastic vapes on the market at this price point.
Swappable battery
The XMax Starry V3 vaporizer is powered by a single 18650 type battery with a capacity of 2600 mAh that can be easily swapped out, giving it the ability to last much longer than an ordinary vape with a built-in battery.
With replaceable batteries, you can always have a new battery to replace when your current one is discharged. Perfect if you are away from home for a long time or if you just want to avoid thinking about charging batteries for a while.
Adjustable temperature and wide temperature range
The reliable ceramic oven in the Starry V3 can heat up to any temperature between 100°C and 240°C and is very fast at doing it so! Heating it to 200°C only takes 25 seconds and heating it to max temp (240°C) takes around 35 seconds.
Excellent vapour quality
XMax is well known for crafting reliable devices that produces good tasting vapour without costing too much. Like their other vapes, the XMax Starry V3 is using a ceramic conduction oven which holds up to 0.5 grams of herb and produces potent vapour quickly.
Your herbs or concentrate will never touch anything but clean materials like stainless steel and high-quality ceramic – ensuring that the vapour stays pure and full of flavours.
Easy to use
The Starry V3 is one of the most intuitive devices on the market. You can control three features with just a few buttons: turn it on/off, adjust temperature and set session time. Plus, there's also an OLED display to show you battery life as well as temperature readings so no more guessing! And if that wasn't enough for you, this device will vibrate gently when vaping the desired temperature has been reached.
The bevelled oven ring makes loading easy, and the magnetic mouthpiece won't get lost while filling it. With a ceramic zirconia mouthpiece that is strong and super smooth for comfortable use, you'll be able to preserve taste with every draw!
Ready for concentrates
The XMax Starry V3 is capable of vaporizing both herbs and concentrates with ease. The vape has a special concentrate pad designed for wax or oil vaping, making it perfect for those who like to mix their habits up from time-to-time.
Warranty
All XMax Starry V3 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of XMax, are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty on the device and a 6-month warranty on the battery.

Who is XMax Starry V3 for?
The XMax Starry V3 is the perfect portable vaporizer for those looking to save money while still getting a quality product. It boasts features such as digital display, wide temperature range, swappable battery and haptic feedback (new for this version) that you won't find on other units at twice its price.
The sleek design makes it perfect for anyone looking to discreetly vape their favourite herbs without drawing too much attention from others when they are out exploring new horizons; and as the battery is swappable it's possible to carry an extra one or two for those long trips!
High-quality build
To find an affordable vape with high quality that is functional and aesthetically pleasing to the eye can seem like an impossible task. The XMax Starry V3 has been created with you in mind! With an outer case of aluminium and a ceramic zirconia mouthpiece, this stealthy vaporizer stands out from the sea of plastic vapes on the market at this price point.
Swappable battery
The XMax Starry V3 vaporizer is powered by a single 18650 type battery with a capacity of 2600 mAh that can be easily swapped out, giving it the ability to last much longer than an ordinary vape with a built-in battery.
With replaceable batteries, you can always have a new battery to replace when your current one is discharged. Perfect if you are away from home for a long time or if you just want to avoid thinking about charging batteries for a while.
Adjustable temperature and wide temperature range
The reliable ceramic oven in the Starry V3 can heat up to any temperature between 100°C and 240°C and is very fast at doing it so! Heating it to 200°C only takes 25 seconds and heating it to max temp (240°C) takes around 35 seconds.
Excellent vapour quality
XMax is well known for crafting reliable devices that produces good tasting vapour without costing too much. Like their other vapes, the XMax Starry V3 is using a ceramic conduction oven which holds up to 0.5 grams of herb and produces potent vapour quickly.
Your herbs or concentrate will never touch anything but clean materials like stainless steel and high-quality ceramic – ensuring that the vapour stays pure and full of flavours.
Easy to use
The Starry V3 is one of the most intuitive devices on the market. You can control three features with just a few buttons: turn it on/off, adjust temperature and set session time. Plus, there's also an OLED display to show you battery life as well as temperature readings so no more guessing! And if that wasn't enough for you, this device will vibrate gently when vaping the desired temperature has been reached.
The bevelled oven ring makes loading easy, and the magnetic mouthpiece won't get lost while filling it. With a ceramic zirconia mouthpiece that is strong and super smooth for comfortable use, you'll be able to preserve taste with every draw!
Ready for concentrates
The XMax Starry V3 is capable of vaporizing both herbs and concentrates with ease. The vape has a special concentrate pad designed for wax or oil vaping, making it perfect for those who like to mix their habits up from time-to-time.
Warranty
All XMax Starry V3 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of XMax, are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty on the device and a 6-month warranty on the battery.

Who is XMax Starry V3 for?
The XMax Starry V3 is the perfect portable vaporizer for those looking to save money while still getting a quality product. It boasts features such as digital display, wide temperature range, swappable battery and haptic feedback (new for this version) that you won't find on other units at twice its price.
The sleek design makes it perfect for anyone looking to discreetly vape their favourite herbs without drawing too much attention from others when they are out exploring new horizons; and as the battery is swappable it's possible to carry an extra one or two for those long trips!
High-quality build
To find an affordable vape with high quality that is functional and aesthetically pleasing to the eye can seem like an impossible task. The XMax Starry V3 has been created with you in mind! With an outer case of aluminium and a ceramic zirconia mouthpiece, this stealthy vaporizer stands out from the sea of plastic vapes on the market at this price point.
Swappable battery
The XMax Starry V3 vaporizer is powered by a single 18650 type battery with a capacity of 2600 mAh that can be easily swapped out, giving it the ability to last much longer than an ordinary vape with a built-in battery.
With replaceable batteries, you can always have a new battery to replace when your current one is discharged. Perfect if you are away from home for a long time or if you just want to avoid thinking about charging batteries for a while.
Adjustable temperature and wide temperature range
The reliable ceramic oven in the Starry V3 can heat up to any temperature between 100°C and 240°C and is very fast at doing it so! Heating it to 200°C only takes 25 seconds and heating it to max temp (240°C) takes around 35 seconds.
Excellent vapour quality
XMax is well known for crafting reliable devices that produces good tasting vapour without costing too much. Like their other vapes, the XMax Starry V3 is using a ceramic conduction oven which holds up to 0.5 grams of herb and produces potent vapour quickly.
Your herbs or concentrate will never touch anything but clean materials like stainless steel and high-quality ceramic – ensuring that the vapour stays pure and full of flavours.
Easy to use
The Starry V3 is one of the most intuitive devices on the market. You can control three features with just a few buttons: turn it on/off, adjust temperature and set session time. Plus, there's also an OLED display to show you battery life as well as temperature readings so no more guessing! And if that wasn't enough for you, this device will vibrate gently when vaping the desired temperature has been reached.
The bevelled oven ring makes loading easy, and the magnetic mouthpiece won't get lost while filling it. With a ceramic zirconia mouthpiece that is strong and super smooth for comfortable use, you'll be able to preserve taste with every draw!
Ready for concentrates
The XMax Starry V3 is capable of vaporizing both herbs and concentrates with ease. The vape has a special concentrate pad designed for wax or oil vaping, making it perfect for those who like to mix their habits up from time-to-time.
Warranty
All XMax Starry V3 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of XMax, are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty on the device and a 6-month warranty on the battery.

Who is the Flowermate Aura for?
Specifically designed with maximum convenience and ease of use in mind, the Flowermate Aura vaporizer is the perfect choice for people frequently on-the-go who value portability. Its incredibly easy temperature control makes it ideal for beginners too! Featuring a distinctive pen-like shape for ease of carriage in a bag or pocket, this compact vape is a classic for a reason.
Sleek Design for Better Taste & Safety
Due to its compact streamlined shape, the Flowermate Aura features an innovative heating chamber alongside a fully isolated air path. Allowing all vapour to pass through without encountering any electronics or barriers, the potency and taste of your herbs will be dramatically cleaner and improved. Eliminating the risk of unpleasant odours, gassing or even combustion, the cutting-edge design of this vape ensures premium safety – and great taste at all times!
Discreet & Portable
Measuring-in at just 15 cm long with a pen-shaped structure, the Flowermate Aura is superbly discreet and concealable to carry around. Perfect for slipping inside your pocket or bag when on-the-go, you can enjoy a quality vaping experience even when away from home. Better still, its useful safety power lock ensures it won’t accidentally turn on if being knocked around in your bag – the power button requires at least 5 consecutive presses for the device to power-up and begin heating.
Impressive Battery Life
When activated on a fully-charged battery, the Flowermate Aura can provide up to 2 full hours of vaping. Its built-in battery can be conveniently charged via USB, meaning you’ll never have to mess around with removing and replacing heavy batteries.
Multi-Functional
Unlike many other alternatives on the market, this vape effortlessly vaporizes dry herbs, waxes and liquids. Giving full power and control over what you choose to vape during your sessions, the interchangeable pods mean its inner heating chamber can easily accommodate virtually anything you wish to transform into vapour.
Fast, Adjustable Temperature
All vapers understand the importance of temperature control, and the Flowermate Aura provides just that. Featuring a convenient LED display providing accurate temperature readings at all times, simply press the corresponding + or - buttons on the vape to adjust the heat to suit your requirements. Better still, the Flowermate Aura is able to fully heat itself within 60 seconds, meaning you’ll never be left bored and waiting.

Newest version! (2023.07)
Lightweight & discreet
Hybrid heating
Impressive battery life with pass-through technology
Fast heating time
Easy to use
Who is the AirVape Xs GO for?
The ideal choice for both beginners and pro-vapers due to its easy-to-use function and high quality performance, the AirVape Xs GO is an improved version of its predecessor – the AirVape Xs. Boasting a smaller, more discreet shape guaranteed to fit in the palm of your hand for ultimate discretion when out and about, this portable vaporizer features single button control and a selection of five temperature settings to choose from. So, if you’re looking for a no-frills vaporizer that produces quality vapour without hassle when on-the-go, the AirVape Xs GO is a great choice.
Compact Design
A top selling point for the AirVape Xs GO is its impressively small size. Specifically created to fit into virtually any pocket or purse without feeling heavy or bulky, this compact vape weighs just 57g for ultimate ease of carriage. Simplistic and featuring a useful magnetic mouthpiece that’s easy to remove for loading and cleaning purposes, this discreet nature of the AirVape Xs GO makes it a real winner.
Hybrid Heating
The AirVape Xs GO utilizes a hybrid convection/conduction heating function, allowing your herbs to be evenly heated for maximum efficiency. Also complete with a dual filter system present in both the mouthpiece and chamber, you’re guaranteed to experience velvety smooth vapour clouds every single time. The AirVape Xs GO may appear small, but it certainly packs a punch in terms of performance.
Pass-Through Technology
Whilst portable vapes definitely have their advantages, many simply won’t function whilst being charged. So, if your session lasts longer than intended and you find your vaporizer completely runs out of power, you’re forced to wait for it to charge before using it again. However, the AirVape Xs Pro boasts pass-through technology within its battery system, allowing you to charge its built-in 1200mAh battery and us it at the same time! Meaning you’ll never have to cut a session short due to dead battery, the versatile nature of this vape is very impressive.
Easy to Use
The AirVape Xs GO has a single button to carry out all functions, making it a brilliant option for beginners who may feel intimidated by some of the more complex vapes available on the market. And with a built-in packing tool included, all aspects of using this vape have been carefully designed to be as simple as possible.
Also offering 5 pre-set temperatures for you to choose from (180, 190, 200, 207 & 215°C), selecting and experiencing a specific temperature is super simple. However, if you enjoy having full control over your vaporizer’s heat without being restricted, you may find the AirVape Xs GO a little limited.
Warranty
The AirVape Xs GO comes with a 3-year warranty by MagicVaporizers and an additional limited lifetime warranty through the manufacturer.

Who is the AirVape Xs GO for?
The ideal choice for both beginners and pro-vapers due to its easy-to-use function and high quality performance, the AirVape Xs GO is an improved version of its predecessor – the AirVape Xs. Boasting a smaller, more discreet shape guaranteed to fit in the palm of your hand for ultimate discretion when out and about, this portable vaporizer features single button control and a selection of five temperature settings to choose from. So, if you’re looking for a no-frills vaporizer that produces quality vapour without hassle when on-the-go, the AirVape Xs GO is a great choice.
Compact Design
A top selling point for the AirVape Xs GO is its impressively small size. Specifically created to fit into virtually any pocket or purse without feeling heavy or bulky, this compact vape weighs just 57g for ultimate ease of carriage. Simplistic and featuring a useful magnetic mouthpiece that’s easy to remove for loading and cleaning purposes, this discreet nature of the AirVape Xs GO makes it a real winner.
Hybrid Heating
The AirVape Xs GO utilizes a hybrid convection/conduction heating function, allowing your herbs to be evenly heated for maximum efficiency. Also complete with a dual filter system present in both the mouthpiece and chamber, you’re guaranteed to experience velvety smooth vapour clouds every single time. The AirVape Xs GO may appear small, but it certainly packs a punch in terms of performance.
Pass-Through Technology
Whilst portable vapes definitely have their advantages, many simply won’t function whilst being charged. So, if your session lasts longer than intended and you find your vaporizer completely runs out of power, you’re forced to wait for it to charge before using it again. However, the AirVape Xs Pro boasts pass-through technology within its battery system, allowing you to charge its built-in 1200mAh battery and us it at the same time! Meaning you’ll never have to cut a session short due to dead battery, the versatile nature of this vape is very impressive.
Easy to Use
The AirVape Xs GO has a single button to carry out all functions, making it a brilliant option for beginners who may feel intimidated by some of the more complex vapes available on the market. And with a built-in packing tool included, all aspects of using this vape have been carefully designed to be as simple as possible.
Also offering 5 pre-set temperatures for you to choose from (180, 190, 200, 207 & 215°C), selecting and experiencing a specific temperature is super simple. However, if you enjoy having full control over your vaporizer’s heat without being restricted, you may find the AirVape Xs GO a little limited.
Warranty
The AirVape Xs GO comes with a 3-year warranty by MagicVaporizers and an additional limited lifetime warranty through the manufacturer.

Who is the Boundless CFC 2.0 for?
The Boundless CFC 2.0 is the improved version of the Boundless CFC, and it’s not hard to see why. A great option if you’re seeking a reliable, long-lasting vape that offers the perfect balance of lightweight portability with impressive performance, the Boundless CFC 2.0 is sure to impress. Pocket-sized without compromising on thick vapour clouds or advanced technology, this vaporizer will make an asset to your next vaping experience.
Pocket Sized & Discreet
Hailed for its compact ability to fit into virtually any pocket or purse, the Boundless CFC 2.0 is a brilliant choice for on-the-go vaping sessions and hits.  It’s so slim that you can hide in the palm of your hand and which opens up a lot more possibilities for stealthy vaping.
Better still, the Boundless CFC 2.0 boasts a significant design improvement. Featuring a super strong, reinforced mouthpiece and outer shell for maximum durability, this vape has been built to stand the test of time yet maintain a sleek, compact appearance.
Impressive Battery Life
The Boundless CFC 2.0 is minimal and compact, so it makes sense to assume its battery life wouldn’t be fantastic. But this couldn’t be further from the truth, as this vape was able to withstand up to 10 sessions throughout testing. Easily able to get you through the day provided you’re sensible with temperature control, the Boundless CFC 2.0 takes 3 hours to fully charge. And as it's chargeable via USB, you can successfully charge it anywhere with a USB port!
Full Temperature Control & Fast Heating Time
Giving you the power to select any temperature between 60°C and 230°C, you aren’t confined to limited pre-set temperatures with the Boundless CFC 2.0. And as this device can heat-up fully in just 30 seconds, it’s certainly a miniature powerhouse guaranteed never to leave you waiting long for your session to begin. Better still, its handy digital display provides accurate temperature readings whilst in use, alongside battery status too.
Improved Airflow
The Boundless CFC 2.0 offers greatly improved airflow than its predecessor, guaranteeing outstandingly thick, rich vapour clouds every single time. Its mouthpiece is fully heat-resistant to provide maximum comfort, and the flavour and smoothness of the vapour produced is very impressive.
Low Maintenance
Due to the simplistic design of the Boundless CFC 2.0, you’ll never find yourself struggling to keep it clean. In fact, the only components requiring cleaning are the digital display screen, mouthpiece and inner oven, all of which are simple to wipe and keep hygienic between sessions.
Warranty
All Boundless CFC 2.0 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Boundless Vapes Technology, are completely authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty.

Who is the Boundless CFC 2.0 for?
The Boundless CFC 2.0 is the improved version of the Boundless CFC, and it’s not hard to see why. A great option if you’re seeking a reliable, long-lasting vape that offers the perfect balance of lightweight portability with impressive performance, the Boundless CFC 2.0 is sure to impress. Pocket-sized without compromising on thick vapour clouds or advanced technology, this vaporizer will make an asset to your next vaping experience.
Pocket Sized & Discreet
Hailed for its compact ability to fit into virtually any pocket or purse, the Boundless CFC 2.0 is a brilliant choice for on-the-go vaping sessions and hits.  It’s so slim that you can hide in the palm of your hand and which opens up a lot more possibilities for stealthy vaping.
Better still, the Boundless CFC 2.0 boasts a significant design improvement. Featuring a super strong, reinforced mouthpiece and outer shell for maximum durability, this vape has been built to stand the test of time yet maintain a sleek, compact appearance.
Impressive Battery Life
The Boundless CFC 2.0 is minimal and compact, so it makes sense to assume its battery life wouldn’t be fantastic. But this couldn’t be further from the truth, as this vape was able to withstand up to 10 sessions throughout testing. Easily able to get you through the day provided you’re sensible with temperature control, the Boundless CFC 2.0 takes 3 hours to fully charge. And as it's chargeable via USB, you can successfully charge it anywhere with a USB port!
Full Temperature Control & Fast Heating Time
Giving you the power to select any temperature between 60°C and 230°C, you aren’t confined to limited pre-set temperatures with the Boundless CFC 2.0. And as this device can heat-up fully in just 30 seconds, it’s certainly a miniature powerhouse guaranteed never to leave you waiting long for your session to begin. Better still, its handy digital display provides accurate temperature readings whilst in use, alongside battery status too.
Improved Airflow
The Boundless CFC 2.0 offers greatly improved airflow than its predecessor, guaranteeing outstandingly thick, rich vapour clouds every single time. Its mouthpiece is fully heat-resistant to provide maximum comfort, and the flavour and smoothness of the vapour produced is very impressive.
Low Maintenance
Due to the simplistic design of the Boundless CFC 2.0, you’ll never find yourself struggling to keep it clean. In fact, the only components requiring cleaning are the digital display screen, mouthpiece and inner oven, all of which are simple to wipe and keep hygienic between sessions.
Warranty
All Boundless CFC 2.0 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Boundless Vapes Technology, are completely authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty.

It includes a large collapsible silicone bowl that, when expanded, provides a spill-safe area for weighing your material and when the bowl is collapsed it can be latched with a lid to keep the scale safe from knocks.
The results are easy to read from the extra-large LCD with pink backlight and the built-in overload protection helps prevent damage to the scale. Other features include automatic piece counting, power-saving auto-off after 3 minutes of inactivity, tare/zero feature for subtracting the weight of a container or expansion tray, and easy one-touch calibration.

Who is the Arizer V-Tower for?
For those seeking a no-fuss vaporizer guaranteed to produce quality vapour every time, the Arizer V-Tower is definitely worth investigating. Providing great results at an impressively affordable price, the simplistic nature of this desktop vaporizer makes it an ideal option for beginners – yet the quality of its vapour makes it equally suitable for seasoned vapers too.
Precise Temperature Control
Offering a wide selection of heat options ranging from 50°C to 260°C, the Arizer V-Tower puts all the power in your hands. Allowing you to have full precise control over the heat your vaporizer creates, vaping your herbs to suit your exact specifications has never been easier! You can also use this impressive temperature range and ease of control for experimentation purposes too if you’re a beginner, allowing you to identify the heat setting you enjoy most without being forced to navigate around complex mechanisms.
Value for Money
It’s no secret there are certainly vaporizers out there with more elaborate features than the Arizer V-Tower, but if you’re simply looking for a straight-up quality vaporizer with no frills or fuss you won’t get better value for money than this! You’re able to enjoy great vapour regardless of temperature at a truly incredible price, and won’t have to endure a range of features you may not even use.
Versatile
The Arizer V-Tower can be used for more than just vaporizing herbs. Equipped to be used as a steamer, essential oils diffuser, pot pourri warmer & even an aromatherapy device, the possibilities achievable with this sole vaporizer are second-to-none. A truly multi-purpose product suitable for a wide variety of occasions and settings, the Arizer V-Tower is definitely more than just a simple vaporizer.
Great Tasting Vapour
Due to its innovative design and heating methods, the vapour produced by the Arizer V-Tower is guaranteed to look, feel & taste superb every time. The combination of its lengthy whip, ceramic heating unit and glass bowl ensures premium potency and flavour with every single vapour cloud. And due to the ceramic structure of its heating element, no unpleasant metal-like tastes or toxins will inadvertently make their way into your vapour.
Automatic Shut-Off for Maximum Safety
Falling asleep as a result of vaping isn’t out of the ordinary. But if you accidentally drift away without switching-off your vaporizer, you could be at risk. However, the Arizer V-Tower boasts a handy auto shut-off timer specifically designed to keep you safe and secure at all times. Customisable with either a 2 or 4-hour setting, this device will automatically shut itself off if inactive without being manually deactivated.
Warranty
The electronics of the Arizer V-Tower are covered by a 3-year warranty, while the ceramic heating element comes with a lifetime warranty.

Who is the Arizer V-Tower for?
For those seeking a no-fuss vaporizer guaranteed to produce quality vapour every time, the Arizer V-Tower is definitely worth investigating. Providing great results at an impressively affordable price, the simplistic nature of this desktop vaporizer makes it an ideal option for beginners – yet the quality of its vapour makes it equally suitable for seasoned vapers too.
Precise Temperature Control
Offering a wide selection of heat options ranging from 50°C to 260°C, the Arizer V-Tower puts all the power in your hands. Allowing you to have full precise control over the heat your vaporizer creates, vaping your herbs to suit your exact specifications has never been easier! You can also use this impressive temperature range and ease of control for experimentation purposes too if you’re a beginner, allowing you to identify the heat setting you enjoy most without being forced to navigate around complex mechanisms.
Value for Money
It’s no secret there are certainly vaporizers out there with more elaborate features than the Arizer V-Tower, but if you’re simply looking for a straight-up quality vaporizer with no frills or fuss you won’t get better value for money than this! You’re able to enjoy great vapour regardless of temperature at a truly incredible price, and won’t have to endure a range of features you may not even use.
Versatile
The Arizer V-Tower can be used for more than just vaporizing herbs. Equipped to be used as a steamer, essential oils diffuser, pot pourri warmer & even an aromatherapy device, the possibilities achievable with this sole vaporizer are second-to-none. A truly multi-purpose product suitable for a wide variety of occasions and settings, the Arizer V-Tower is definitely more than just a simple vaporizer.
Great Tasting Vapour
Due to its innovative design and heating methods, the vapour produced by the Arizer V-Tower is guaranteed to look, feel & taste superb every time. The combination of its lengthy whip, ceramic heating unit and glass bowl ensures premium potency and flavour with every single vapour cloud. And due to the ceramic structure of its heating element, no unpleasant metal-like tastes or toxins will inadvertently make their way into your vapour.
Automatic Shut-Off for Maximum Safety
Falling asleep as a result of vaping isn’t out of the ordinary. But if you accidentally drift away without switching-off your vaporizer, you could be at risk. However, the Arizer V-Tower boasts a handy auto shut-off timer specifically designed to keep you safe and secure at all times. Customisable with either a 2 or 4-hour setting, this device will automatically shut itself off if inactive without being manually deactivated.
Warranty
The electronics of the Arizer V-Tower are covered by a 3-year warranty, while the ceramic heating element comes with a lifetime warranty.

Experience a new way of grinding with Flower Mill's patented design Premium Edition Grinder that rolls the herbs, gently crumbling them to a soft, fluffy texture.
How to use
Simply remove the top, place the herbs inside, and put the top back. Twist gently with even pressure, listening for a change in sound to indicate completion. Access your freshly grinded herbs by removing the lower catch.
Hybrid construction
Enjoy the benefits of food grade (304) stainless steel and lightweight aircraft grade (6061) aluminium, providing a safe and durable way of grinding your herbs.
Crumble instead of shred
Discover the extra fluffy texture, as the Flower Mill crumbles your herbs rather than shredding, ensuring a lighter and fluffier product. This helps vaporizers thoroughly extract the herbs thanks to the improved air flow through the herbs.
Perfect size
The specially designed rotor processes your herbs to the perfect size for vaping, leaving no partially processed herb behind.
Low effort
The Premium Grinder is easy to use, with a magnetic closure on the top lid and with a  lower collector that only requires a quarter-turn for effortless removal.
Large capacity
With a deep chamber and no teeth taking up space, you can process up to 3,5 g of herbs at a time in this 2,5" (6.35 cm) grinder.
Easy cleaning
Fully disassemble all parts for complete access and thorough cleaning.
Swappable screens
The included medium screen delivers grinded herbs that is optimal size for most vaporizers by ensuring small enough pieces for efficient vaporization while maintaining easy airflow.
If you want more options, the Screen Kit (sold separately), contains four screens of varying sizes. The fine and super fine screens are perfect for maximising the  surface area making them ideal for getting grinded herbs ready micro dosing.

Who is the Arizer XQ2 for?
It’s been over ten years since Arizer revolutionized the stationary vape market with their launch of the Arizer Extreme Q. Now it's finally time for its successor – the Arizer XQ2.
After listening to customer feedback, Arizer have made several significant improvements compared to the original. New for the Arizer XQ2 is the innovative coloured LED lights that lets you know its current status, the improved herb glass bowl and the re-engineered air flow, making sure only the purest and tastiest vapour reaches your lips.
The best part about this vaporizer is that it’s designed for everyone - whether you're a seasoned user or just getting started. With plenty of features, fast heating and high-quality parts you can rest assured that if you buy the Arizer XQ2, you will get a stationary vape that will last for years.
Choose between whip or balloon
The XQ2 is a great vaporizer for those who want a balance of both direct draw and balloon style vaping. The new heating chambers have borosilicate glass screens which make it easy to keep your vapour pure, as well as an updated balloon system with silicone caps so you can easily keep the vapour that's been filled in the balloon.
New and improved features
The XQ2 has been improved in many areas, but the most significant improvement is that the XQ2 comes with two upgraded herb bowls; one large for getting dense and heavy vapour, and a small one for more control and microdosing. Another new thing is the LED lights that not only make it look cool in the dark, but they also communicate when it is heating up and have reached the set temperature!
You can choose between three modes for the LED lights. Standard, where you select one of the eight colours and it stays lit in that colour. Spectrum, which changes the colour every two seconds, and the most useful; Dynamic. In Dynamic mode the LED lights changes according to the following logic:
Pulses from yellow to orange - Heating
Blinks green twice - Reached Set Temperature
Pulses orange - Temperature is stable
Pulses purple - Fan is enabled
Pulses cyan - Cooling down
Pulses blue - Cooling down with fan
Remote control
Control your vaporizer from afar with the XQ2’s simpler, programmable remote control. This easy-to-use and reliable gadget come with everything you need to start or end a session without ever having to touch it!
With the remote, you can turn the vape on/off, set the temperature and control the fan. There are also three programmable temperature settings you can set to your favourite temperatures for quick selection. Of course, if you lose the remote somewhere you can always control all settings from the buttons on the unit too.
Faster heat-up time
The XQ2 really sets itself apart from its predecessor with a faster heat-up time. Thanks to an improved heating element that uses power more efficiently it will reach the target temperature within 1-2 minutes of starting it up, depending on the temperature set. Those who prefer to vape using the balloon can expect the balloon to fully fill up with vapour within 2-4 minutes depending on the selected fan speed.
Flavourful vapour
If you want to enjoy potent and tasty vapour then The Arizer XQ2 vaporizer is a great choice as it utilizes ceramic heating elements and full convection heating with open airflow so your herbs can be fully vaped without combustion! The glass construction also ensures purity for all those who care about their vaping experience being as pure and flavourful as possible.
Great value
The XQ2 is a highly competitive budget-friendly vaporizer that has most of the features as the Volcano Hybrid but at an affordable price! With its easy controls and wide selection of accessories it's certain that the XQ2 will have its place in the stationary vape market for years to come.
Warranty
The electronics of the Arizer XQ2 are covered by a 3-year warranty, while the ceramic heating element comes with a lifetime warranty.

Stop pulverizing your herbs
Experience a new way of grinding with Flower Mill's patented design Premium Edition Grinder that rolls the herbs, gently crumbling them to a soft, fluffy texture.
How to use
Simply remove the top, place the herbs inside, and put the top back. Twist gently with even pressure, listening for a change in sound to indicate completion. Access your freshly grinded herbs by removing the lower catch.
Hybrid construction
Enjoy the benefits of food grade (304) stainless steel and lightweight aircraft grade (6061) aluminium, providing a safe and durable way of grinding your herbs.
Crumble instead of shred
Discover the extra fluffy texture, as the Flower Mill crumbles your herbs rather than shredding, ensuring a lighter and fluffier product. This helps vaporizers thoroughly extract the herbs thanks to the improved air flow through the herbs.
Perfect size
The specially designed rotor processes your herbs to the perfect size for vaping, leaving no partially processed herb behind.
Low effort
The Premium Grinder is easy to use, with a magnetic closure on the top lid and with a  lower collector that only requires a quarter-turn for effortless removal.
Large capacity
With a deep chamber and no teeth taking up space, you can process up to 3,5 g of herbs at a time in this 2,5" (6.35 cm) grinder.
Easy cleaning
Fully disassemble all parts for complete access and thorough cleaning.
Swappable screens
The included medium screen delivers grinded herbs that is optimal size for most vaporizers by ensuring small enough pieces for efficient vaporization while maintaining easy airflow.
If you want more options, the Screen Kit (sold separately), contains four screens of varying sizes. The fine and super fine screens are perfect for maximising the  surface area making them ideal for getting grinded herbs ready micro dosing.

Who is the Arizer XQ2 for?
It’s been over ten years since Arizer revolutionized the stationary vape market with their launch of the Arizer Extreme Q. Now it's finally time for its successor – the Arizer XQ2.
After listening to customer feedback, Arizer have made several significant improvements compared to the original. New for the Arizer XQ2 is the innovative coloured LED lights that lets you know its current status, the improved herb glass bowl and the re-engineered air flow, making sure only the purest and tastiest vapour reaches your lips.
The best part about this vaporizer is that it’s designed for everyone - whether you're a seasoned user or just getting started. With plenty of features, fast heating and high-quality parts you can rest assured that if you buy the Arizer XQ2, you will get a stationary vape that will last for years.
Choose between whip or balloon
The XQ2 is a great vaporizer for those who want a balance of both direct draw and balloon style vaping. The new heating chambers have borosilicate glass screens which make it easy to keep your vapour pure, as well as an updated balloon system with silicone caps so you can easily keep the vapour that's been filled in the balloon.
New and improved features
The XQ2 has been improved in many areas, but the most significant improvement is that the XQ2 comes with two upgraded herb bowls; one large for getting dense and heavy vapour, and a small one for more control and microdosing. Another new thing is the LED lights that not only make it look cool in the dark, but they also communicate when it is heating up and have reached the set temperature!
You can choose between three modes for the LED lights. Standard, where you select one of the eight colours and it stays lit in that colour. Spectrum, which changes the colour every two seconds, and the most useful; Dynamic. In Dynamic mode the LED lights changes according to the following logic:
Pulses from yellow to orange - Heating
Blinks green twice - Reached Set Temperature
Pulses orange - Temperature is stable
Pulses purple - Fan is enabled
Pulses cyan - Cooling down
Pulses blue - Cooling down with fan
Remote control
Control your vaporizer from afar with the XQ2’s simpler, programmable remote control. This easy-to-use and reliable gadget come with everything you need to start or end a session without ever having to touch it!
With the remote, you can turn the vape on/off, set the temperature and control the fan. There are also three programmable temperature settings you can set to your favourite temperatures for quick selection. Of course, if you lose the remote somewhere you can always control all settings from the buttons on the unit too.
Faster heat-up time
The XQ2 really sets itself apart from its predecessor with a faster heat-up time. Thanks to an improved heating element that uses power more efficiently it will reach the target temperature within 1-2 minutes of starting it up, depending on the temperature set. Those who prefer to vape using the balloon can expect the balloon to fully fill up with vapour within 2-4 minutes depending on the selected fan speed.
Flavourful vapour
If you want to enjoy potent and tasty vapour then The Arizer XQ2 vaporizer is a great choice as it utilizes ceramic heating elements and full convection heating with open airflow so your herbs can be fully vaped without combustion! The glass construction also ensures purity for all those who care about their vaping experience being as pure and flavourful as possible.
Great value
The XQ2 is a highly competitive budget-friendly vaporizer that has most of the features as the Volcano Hybrid but at an affordable price! With its easy controls and wide selection of accessories it's certain that the XQ2 will have its place in the stationary vape market for years to come.
Warranty
The electronics of the Arizer XQ2 are covered by a 3-year warranty, while the ceramic heating element comes with a lifetime warranty.

Unique design
Who is the Plenty Vaporizer for?
Despite its advanced technology and innovative design, the Plenty Vaporizer is perfectly suitable for both experienced vapers and beginners. Simple to operate yet offering more than enough control and quality to satisfy even the pickiest of vaping enthusiasts, the Plenty Vaporizer is a stand-out desktop vape with an extra-large chamber – ideal for group sessions. Featuring a design resembling a household power tool and created by the same company responsible for the iconic Volcano, the Plenty Vaporizer is a great choice if you value both performance and great taste during your sessions.
Cutting-Edge Performance
Made using the highest quality medical grade materials, the Plenty Vaporizer guarantees premium performance and durability with every session. Featuring an exceptionally-built inner chamber and a superbly effective stainless steel coil for cooling purposes, full-bodied, strongly flavoured vapour is produced for your enjoyment. Its innovative heating technology also provides superbly even heating for your entire herb load, reducing risk of burning and ensuring consistently great tasting vapour.
Easy Temperature Control
The Plenty Vaporizer offers seven pre-set temperature choices, all operated via a simple wheel mechanism on the device’s side. Visible from a useful analogue temperature gauge displayed on the front, temperatures range from 37°C to 215°C. And if you’re still learning the ropes and aren’t completely sure which temperature is most appropriate for your session, the Plenty Vaporizer’s temperature dial displays a useful green heat zone to keep you in-the-know about what the optimum temperature is likely to be.
Free of Batteries
The Plenty Vaporizer has been specifically created for reliable desktop use, meaning you’ll never have to bother with replacing batteries or recharging the device. Powered by simply plugging straight into the wall, the durability of this vaporizer is simply second-to-none. And as it’s been carefully crafted using only the best quality materials throughout its entire structure, the lack of electronic components within the Plenty Vaporizer guarantees optimum reliability and longevity – meaning you have a vaporizer here sure to last for many years to come.
Easy to Use
Whilst many desktop vaporizers may appear a little more intimidating than smaller portable options, the Plenty Vaporizer has been designed with ease of use in mind. Simply pack-in your chosen herbs, connect the accompanying coil, replace the top and select a temperature setting. Once switched-on, this vaporizer can fully heat-up and begin producing top-quality vapour in just a few minutes. And if the heat potency begins to decrease, the device’s indicator light will stop glowing for instant notification. Simply requiring a mere push of a button on the handle, maintaining consistent heat throughout your entire session duration is easy.
Warranty
All Plenty Vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Great tasting vapour

Extra-large chamber
Cooling steel coil
Unique design
Who is the Plenty Vaporizer for?
Despite its advanced technology and innovative design, the Plenty Vaporizer is perfectly suitable for both experienced vapers and beginners. Simple to operate yet offering more than enough control and quality to satisfy even the pickiest of vaping enthusiasts, the Plenty Vaporizer is a stand-out desktop vape with an extra-large chamber – ideal for group sessions. Featuring a design resembling a household power tool and created by the same company responsible for the iconic Volcano, the Plenty Vaporizer is a great choice if you value both performance and great taste during your sessions.
Cutting-Edge Performance
Made using the highest quality medical grade materials, the Plenty Vaporizer guarantees premium performance and durability with every session. Featuring an exceptionally-built inner chamber and a superbly effective stainless steel coil for cooling purposes, full-bodied, strongly flavoured vapour is produced for your enjoyment. Its innovative heating technology also provides superbly even heating for your entire herb load, reducing risk of burning and ensuring consistently great tasting vapour.
Easy Temperature Control
The Plenty Vaporizer offers seven pre-set temperature choices, all operated via a simple wheel mechanism on the device’s side. Visible from a useful analogue temperature gauge displayed on the front, temperatures range from 37°C to 215°C. And if you’re still learning the ropes and aren’t completely sure which temperature is most appropriate for your session, the Plenty Vaporizer’s temperature dial displays a useful green heat zone to keep you in-the-know about what the optimum temperature is likely to be.
Free of Batteries
The Plenty Vaporizer has been specifically created for reliable desktop use, meaning you’ll never have to bother with replacing batteries or recharging the device. Powered by simply plugging straight into the wall, the durability of this vaporizer is simply second-to-none. And as it’s been carefully crafted using only the best quality materials throughout its entire structure, the lack of electronic components within the Plenty Vaporizer guarantees optimum reliability and longevity – meaning you have a vaporizer here sure to last for many years to come.
Easy to Use
Whilst many desktop vaporizers may appear a little more intimidating than smaller portable options, the Plenty Vaporizer has been designed with ease of use in mind. Simply pack-in your chosen herbs, connect the accompanying coil, replace the top and select a temperature setting. Once switched-on, this vaporizer can fully heat-up and begin producing top-quality vapour in just a few minutes. And if the heat potency begins to decrease, the device’s indicator light will stop glowing for instant notification. Simply requiring a mere push of a button on the handle, maintaining consistent heat throughout your entire session duration is easy.
Warranty
All Plenty Vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Storz & Bickel products, are authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Integrated water filtration
Switchable heating chambers for herb and concentrate

Who is the Hydrology 9 NX for?
The Hydrology 9 NX is a dual functionality vaporizer that's been designed to be both functional and fun to use. The new upgrades include the specific chambers for herb and concentrate, with every detail carefully thought out including perfectly fitting parts made of high-grade materials as well as magnetic features which makes making filling it and cleaning it easier.
If you're looking for an all-in-one vaporizer that can handle everything from dry herbs to concentrate, then the Hydrology 9 NX is what you need. With its built-in water filtration system and cooling capabilities it will provide smooth and tasty vapour for years.
Spill-proof design
The Hydrology 9 NX comes already assembled, though you'll need to unscrew the top piece in order for it to be filled up with water. The spill-proof design ensures that no water can enter to the electrical components.
Herb heating chamber
The Hydrology 9 NX's hybrid heating chamber for herbs makes sure your herbs are heated evenly and thoroughly. This dedicated chamber utilizes dual-layer heating technology which means combining convection with conduction heating to provide you with potent and great tasting vapour every time!
Concentrate chamber
The brand-new concentrate chamber features a revolutionary heating technology and can be used with either the quartz glass bowl or ceramic bowl depending on the desired temperature. This heating system guarantees efficient heat generation, while also covering all areas in the bowl without leaving any cold gaps.
Adjustable temperature dial
The Hydrology 9 NX features a sensor that recognizes the heating chamber and automatically adjusts the temperature levels to provide you with specific settings for both concentrates and herbs.
You change the desired temperature by turning the dial at the bottom of the Hydrology 9 NX. There are 6 different temperature options: 180°C to 235°C for herbs, and 290°C to 410°C for concentrates like oil or waxes.
The temperature level is represented by blue (lowest), light blue, yellow, purple, red, and white (highest). This colour-coded system helps to make it easy for you to know which temperature is set and makes it easy to adjust without having to look at a display.
The Hydrology 9 NX will remain at the set temperature for two minutes before switching to standby and then stay standby until it's shut down or shuts off automatically after 10 minutes.
Swappable battery
Another upgrade from the original Hydrology 9 is the battery that is both more powerful (1900 mAh) and can be swapped out. With a replaceable battery, you can extend the life of your device by purchasing new batteries instead. It is a good idea to buy an extra battery from the beginning if you plan to take your 9 NX on long trips without access to charging options.
During our testing, we found that a fully charged battery is capable of around 5 to 7 sessions of herb vaping, and around 10 to 12 sessions of concentrate vaping.
Magnetic USB charging port
In this new version of Hydrology 9, the charger has been updated and now features a magnetic connection which makes connecting easier than ever before. When plugged in to charge up your device it will flash red until full battery capacity is reached after about an hour from the start of the charging process. The light turns green when it's fully charged so you can know right away when it’s ready!
Cleaning tools included
Cleaning your vaporizer is an easy task with the high-quality cleaning tools that come included. The brushes make it easy to deep clean all parts of this machine at any time, which will keep it working like it's suppose to for a long time!
Warranty
All Hydrology 9 NX vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Cloudious 9, are completely authentic and comes with a 2-year warranty.

Who is the Hydrology 9 NX for?
The Hydrology 9 NX is a dual functionality vaporizer that's been designed to be both functional and fun to use. The new upgrades include the specific chambers for herb and concentrate, with every detail carefully thought out including perfectly fitting parts made of high-grade materials as well as magnetic features which makes making filling it and cleaning it easier.
If you're looking for an all-in-one vaporizer that can handle everything from dry herbs to concentrate, then the Hydrology 9 NX is what you need. With its built-in water filtration system and cooling capabilities it will provide smooth and tasty vapour for years.
Spill-proof design
The Hydrology 9 NX comes already assembled, though you'll need to unscrew the top piece in order for it to be filled up with water. The spill-proof design ensures that no water can enter to the electrical components.
Herb heating chamber
The Hydrology 9 NX's hybrid heating chamber for herbs makes sure your herbs are heated evenly and thoroughly. This dedicated chamber utilizes dual-layer heating technology which means combining convection with conduction heating to provide you with potent and great tasting vapour every time!
Concentrate chamber
The brand-new concentrate chamber features a revolutionary heating technology and can be used with either the quartz glass bowl or ceramic bowl depending on the desired temperature. This heating system guarantees efficient heat generation, while also covering all areas in the bowl without leaving any cold gaps.
Adjustable temperature dial
The Hydrology 9 NX features a sensor that recognizes the heating chamber and automatically adjusts the temperature levels to provide you with specific settings for both concentrates and herbs.
You change the desired temperature by turning the dial at the bottom of the Hydrology 9 NX. There are 6 different temperature options: 180°C to 235°C for herbs, and 290°C to 410°C for concentrates like oil or waxes.
The temperature level is represented by blue (lowest), light blue, yellow, purple, red, and white (highest). This colour-coded system helps to make it easy for you to know which temperature is set and makes it easy to adjust without having to look at a display.
The Hydrology 9 NX will remain at the set temperature for two minutes before switching to standby and then stay standby until it's shut down or shuts off automatically after 10 minutes.
Swappable battery
Another upgrade from the original Hydrology 9 is the battery that is both more powerful (1900 mAh) and can be swapped out. With a replaceable battery, you can extend the life of your device by purchasing new batteries instead. It is a good idea to buy an extra battery from the beginning if you plan to take your 9 NX on long trips without access to charging options.
During our testing, we found that a fully charged battery is capable of around 5 to 7 sessions of herb vaping, and around 10 to 12 sessions of concentrate vaping.
Magnetic USB charging port
In this new version of Hydrology 9, the charger has been updated and now features a magnetic connection which makes connecting easier than ever before. When plugged in to charge up your device it will flash red until full battery capacity is reached after about an hour from the start of the charging process. The light turns green when it's fully charged so you can know right away when it’s ready!

Who is the XVape Fog Pro for?
The XVape Fog Pro is the upgraded version of the XVape Fog that has a larger battery, faster heat-up time, more customisability, and much more. It excels in vaping both herbs and concentrates (with the included wax cup) thanks to the optimised heating chamber that extracts pure and flavourful vapour at any temperature between 100°C to 220°C.
If you are looking for a reliable and easy-to-use convection vaporizer that is easy to bring with you anywhere you will definitely be satisfied with an XVape Fog Pro.
Compact and durable
The XVape Fog Pro has a compact size and durable outer casing made of anodized aluminium which makes it both look fantastic and also is better protected against scratches. Though it’s not big, its weight makes it sturdy to stand on its own and comfortable to hold.
The magnetic top is easily removed so you can access the stainless-steel heating chamber underneath and to ensure you only get the most flavourful vapour, is has a detachable mouthpiece made of Zirconia ceramic.
If you want to stir your herbs or if accidentally packed your them too hard you can use the built-in stirring tool to loosen them up and improve the airflow through the heating chamber.
The latest convection heating technology
To maximise extraction and preserve the flavours from your herbs, the XVape Fog Pro uses the latest convection heating technology. This means that the heated air passes through the herbs or concentrates inside the chamber for even extraction before it passes through the isolated air-path to reach the mouthpiece.
With this kind of heating technology paired with the now even more powerful battery, your will be able to enjoy pure and flavourful vapour in less than 20 seconds!
More features and easier to use
The XVape Fog Pro has made several usability improvements compared to the previous version, and you can now choose from any temperature you want between 100°C to 220°C with a single degree accuracy. You can now also choose the session timer to be either 5 minutes or 10 minutes, depending on how long you plan your session to be.
On the new OLED display, you can see the battery level, set temperature, current temperature and, the session timer. To help you select the temperature and adjust the session timer, the XVape Fog Pro has two more additional buttons, which means changing the settings is quick and easy.
New for this version is also the haptic feedback that makes the unit vibrate when the selected temperature has been reached and when you turn it on and off. If you need discretion, you can have it in your pocket and wait for it to get warm and know when it is ready after the vibration.
Removable battery charged with USB-C
The XVape Fog Pro is equipped with a removable and rechargeable 3200 mAh battery. You can either choose to remove it and charge it with any compatible 18650 battery charger, or charge it with the battery inserted via the USB-C charging port and included USB cable.
If you plan on using your Fog Pro a lot, we recommend to picking up an extra battery or two so you can quickly replace a depleted battery for a fresh one!
For both herbs and concentrate
Thanks to the included wax cup you can not only use the XVape Fog Pro with herbs but also with concentrate. All you have to do is insert the wax cup into the heating chamber and you are good to go! Keep in mind that the max temperature of 220°C means that not all concentrates are optimal to be consumed with the XVape Fog Pro.
How to use the XVape Fog Pro?
Remove the mouthpiece to get access to the heating chamber.
Fill the chamber with your herbs (or use the wax cup for concentrate).
Attach the mouthpiece.
Triple-click the power button to start the heating.
Wait for it to vibrate to indicate it has reached the set temperature (10 to 20 seconds*).
Enjoy the pure and flavourful vapour!
* For optimal vapour quality, we suggest waiting another 20 seconds after temperature has been reached.

Who is the XVape Fog Pro for?
The XVape Fog Pro is the upgraded version of the XVape Fog that has a larger battery, faster heat-up time, more customisability, and much more. It excels in vaping both herbs and concentrates (with the included wax cup) thanks to the optimised heating chamber that extracts pure and flavourful vapour at any temperature between 100°C to 220°C.
If you are looking for a reliable and easy-to-use convection vaporizer that is easy to bring with you anywhere you will definitely be satisfied with an XVape Fog Pro.
Compact and durable
The XVape Fog Pro has a compact size and durable outer casing made of anodized aluminium which makes it both look fantastic and also is better protected against scratches. Though it’s not big, its weight makes it sturdy to stand on its own and comfortable to hold.
The magnetic top is easily removed so you can access the stainless-steel heating chamber underneath and to ensure you only get the most flavourful vapour, is has a detachable mouthpiece made of Zirconia ceramic.
If you want to stir your herbs or if accidentally packed your them too hard you can use the built-in stirring tool to loosen them up and improve the airflow through the heating chamber.
The latest convection heating technology
To maximise extraction and preserve the flavours from your herbs, the XVape Fog Pro uses the latest convection heating technology. This means that the heated air passes through the herbs or concentrates inside the chamber for even extraction before it passes through the isolated air-path to reach the mouthpiece.
With this kind of heating technology paired with the now even more powerful battery, your will be able to enjoy pure and flavourful vapour in less than 20 seconds!
More features and easier to use
The XVape Fog Pro has made several usability improvements compared to the previous version, and you can now choose from any temperature you want between 100°C to 220°C with a single degree accuracy. You can now also choose the session timer to be either 5 minutes or 10 minutes, depending on how long you plan your session to be.
On the new OLED display, you can see the battery level, set temperature, current temperature and, the session timer. To help you select the temperature and adjust the session timer, the XVape Fog Pro has two more additional buttons, which means changing the settings is quick and easy.
New for this version is also the haptic feedback that makes the unit vibrate when the selected temperature has been reached and when you turn it on and off. If you need discretion, you can have it in your pocket and wait for it to get warm and know when it is ready after the vibration.
Removable battery charged with USB-C
The XVape Fog Pro is equipped with a removable and rechargeable 3200 mAh battery. You can either choose to remove it and charge it with any compatible 18650 battery charger, or charge it with the battery inserted via the USB-C charging port and included USB cable.
If you plan on using your Fog Pro a lot, we recommend to picking up an extra battery or two so you can quickly replace a depleted battery for a fresh one!
For both herbs and concentrate
Thanks to the included wax cup you can not only use the XVape Fog Pro with herbs but also with concentrate. All you have to do is insert the wax cup into the heating chamber and you are good to go! Keep in mind that the max temperature of 220°C means that not all concentrates are optimal to be consumed with the XVape Fog Pro.
How to use the XVape Fog Pro?
Remove the mouthpiece to get access to the heating chamber.
Fill the chamber with your herbs (or use the wax cup for concentrate).
Attach the mouthpiece.
Triple-click the power button to start the heating.
Wait for it to vibrate to indicate it has reached the set temperature (10 to 20 seconds*).
Enjoy the pure and flavourful vapour!
* For optimal vapour quality, we suggest waiting another 20 seconds after temperature has been reached.

Who is the AirVape X for?
Hailed as one of the thinnest, most discreet vaporizers available on the market, the AirVape X is the perfect option for those who love taking hits whilst on-the-go. And due to its impressive battery life, this vape is equally suitable for long-lasting sessions too – making it a truly versatile option perfect for both beginners and seasoned vapers.
Compatible with dry herbs, oils, waxes & concentrates and boasting a large herb chamber able to withstand longer sessions, the AirVape X is guaranteed to provide a premium vaping experience.
Slim, Discreet & Lightweight
The AirVape X is renowned for its ultra-thin, lightweight design – and it’s not hard to see why. Specifically created with discreet portability in mind, this vape can easily fit into virtually any pocket and can be discreetly carried around in the palm of your hand. Weighing just 90g yet providing an inner construction sophisticated enough to rival many larger vaporizers, the AirVape X is a true powerhouse despite its small size.
Impressive Performance
Whether you’re seeking to vaporize herbs, oils, waxes or concentrates, the AirVape X guarantees truly brilliant performance at all times. Featuring an in-built hybrid heating system that makes use of both convection and conduction heating methods, the AirVape X ensures every single part of your chosen material is evenly heated. Providing delicious-tasting vapour filled with authentic flavour, this vape’s dual-filter cooling system helps produce silky smooth vapour clouds every time.
25% Bigger Herb Chamber
Offering a larger herb chamber than its predecessor, the AirVape Xs, the AirVape X provides more capacity for even longer sessions to be enjoyed. And due to the larger, more expansive size of the bowl, it makes cleaning and maintenance much easier.
Easy to Use with Full Temperature Control
As the AirVape X can be used to vaporize dry herbs, oils, waves and concentrates, it makes sense to assume its operation would be complicated. But that couldn’t be further from the truth! Featuring just one power button and two convenient temperature control buttons, this vape is effortlessly simple – perfect for beginners.
Also offering the ability to select whichever degree you want between 93°C and 220°C, you have full control over the temperature of your sessions. The useful LED display provides accurate temperature readings at all times, and you can even switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit dependent on your preference.
Powerful Battery
The AirVape X battery requires just one hour to become fully charged, meaning you certainly won’t have to wait long to get a session underway. And as it’s chargeable via USB, you can easily charge this vape whilst on-the-go provided you have access to a USB port.
The AirVape X can easily withstand most session lengths with ease. But if you find the battery begins to diminish before your session is over, this device can still be used while being charged due to its pass-through charging technology.
Warranty
The AirVape X comes with a 2-year warranty by MagicVaporizers and an additional limited lifetime warranty through the manufacturer.

Quality performance
Who is the AirVape X for?
Hailed as one of the thinnest, most discreet vaporizers available on the market, the AirVape X is the perfect option for those who love taking hits whilst on-the-go. And due to its impressive battery life, this vape is equally suitable for long-lasting sessions too – making it a truly versatile option perfect for both beginners and seasoned vapers.
Compatible with dry herbs, oils, waxes & concentrates and boasting a large herb chamber able to withstand longer sessions, the AirVape X is guaranteed to provide a premium vaping experience.
Slim, Discreet & Lightweight
The AirVape X is renowned for its ultra-thin, lightweight design – and it’s not hard to see why. Specifically created with discreet portability in mind, this vape can easily fit into virtually any pocket and can be discreetly carried around in the palm of your hand. Weighing just 90g yet providing an inner construction sophisticated enough to rival many larger vaporizers, the AirVape X is a true powerhouse despite its small size.
Impressive Performance
Whether you’re seeking to vaporize herbs, oils, waxes or concentrates, the AirVape X guarantees truly brilliant performance at all times. Featuring an in-built hybrid heating system that makes use of both convection and conduction heating methods, the AirVape X ensures every single part of your chosen material is evenly heated. Providing delicious-tasting vapour filled with authentic flavour, this vape’s dual-filter cooling system helps produce silky smooth vapour clouds every time.
25% Bigger Herb Chamber
Offering a larger herb chamber than its predecessor, the AirVape Xs, the AirVape X provides more capacity for even longer sessions to be enjoyed. And due to the larger, more expansive size of the bowl, it makes cleaning and maintenance much easier.
Easy to Use with Full Temperature Control
As the AirVape X can be used to vaporize dry herbs, oils, waves and concentrates, it makes sense to assume its operation would be complicated. But that couldn’t be further from the truth! Featuring just one power button and two convenient temperature control buttons, this vape is effortlessly simple – perfect for beginners.
Also offering the ability to select whichever degree you want between 93°C and 220°C, you have full control over the temperature of your sessions. The useful LED display provides accurate temperature readings at all times, and you can even switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit dependent on your preference.
Powerful Battery
The AirVape X battery requires just one hour to become fully charged, meaning you certainly won’t have to wait long to get a session underway. And as it’s chargeable via USB, you can easily charge this vape whilst on-the-go provided you have access to a USB port.
The AirVape X can easily withstand most session lengths with ease. But if you find the battery begins to diminish before your session is over, this device can still be used while being charged due to its pass-through charging technology.
Warranty
The AirVape X comes with a 2-year warranty by MagicVaporizers and an additional limited lifetime warranty through the manufacturer.

Who is the AirVape X for?
Hailed as one of the thinnest, most discreet vaporizers available on the market, the AirVape X is the perfect option for those who love taking hits whilst on-the-go. And due to its impressive battery life, this vape is equally suitable for long-lasting sessions too – making it a truly versatile option perfect for both beginners and seasoned vapers.
Compatible with dry herbs, oils, waxes & concentrates and boasting a large herb chamber able to withstand longer sessions, the AirVape X is guaranteed to provide a premium vaping experience.
Slim, Discreet & Lightweight
The AirVape X is renowned for its ultra-thin, lightweight design – and it’s not hard to see why. Specifically created with discreet portability in mind, this vape can easily fit into virtually any pocket and can be discreetly carried around in the palm of your hand. Weighing just 90g yet providing an inner construction sophisticated enough to rival many larger vaporizers, the AirVape X is a true powerhouse despite its small size.
Impressive Performance
Whether you’re seeking to vaporize herbs, oils, waxes or concentrates, the AirVape X guarantees truly brilliant performance at all times. Featuring an in-built hybrid heating system that makes use of both convection and conduction heating methods, the AirVape X ensures every single part of your chosen material is evenly heated. Providing delicious-tasting vapour filled with authentic flavour, this vape’s dual-filter cooling system helps produce silky smooth vapour clouds every time.
25% Bigger Herb Chamber
Offering a larger herb chamber than its predecessor, the AirVape Xs, the AirVape X provides more capacity for even longer sessions to be enjoyed. And due to the larger, more expansive size of the bowl, it makes cleaning and maintenance much easier.
Easy to Use with Full Temperature Control
As the AirVape X can be used to vaporize dry herbs, oils, waves and concentrates, it makes sense to assume its operation would be complicated. But that couldn’t be further from the truth! Featuring just one power button and two convenient temperature control buttons, this vape is effortlessly simple – perfect for beginners.
Also offering the ability to select whichever degree you want between 93°C and 220°C, you have full control over the temperature of your sessions. The useful LED display provides accurate temperature readings at all times, and you can even switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit dependent on your preference.
Powerful Battery
The AirVape X battery requires just one hour to become fully charged, meaning you certainly won’t have to wait long to get a session underway. And as it’s chargeable via USB, you can easily charge this vape whilst on-the-go provided you have access to a USB port.
The AirVape X can easily withstand most session lengths with ease. But if you find the battery begins to diminish before your session is over, this device can still be used while being charged due to its pass-through charging technology.
Warranty
The AirVape X comes with a 2-year warranty by MagicVaporizers and an additional limited lifetime warranty through the manufacturer.

Other features include automatic piece counting, power-saving auto-off after 3 minutes of inactivity, tare/zero feature for subtracting the weight of a container or expansion tray, and easy one-touch calibration.

Who is the AirVape X for?
Hailed as one of the thinnest, most discreet vaporizers available on the market, the AirVape X is the perfect option for those who love taking hits whilst on-the-go. And due to its impressive battery life, this vape is equally suitable for long-lasting sessions too – making it a truly versatile option perfect for both beginners and seasoned vapers.
Compatible with dry herbs, oils, waxes & concentrates and boasting a large herb chamber able to withstand longer sessions, the AirVape X is guaranteed to provide a premium vaping experience.
Slim, Discreet & Lightweight
The AirVape X is renowned for its ultra-thin, lightweight design – and it’s not hard to see why. Specifically created with discreet portability in mind, this vape can easily fit into virtually any pocket and can be discreetly carried around in the palm of your hand. Weighing just 90g yet providing an inner construction sophisticated enough to rival many larger vaporizers, the AirVape X is a true powerhouse despite its small size.
Impressive Performance
Whether you’re seeking to vaporize herbs, oils, waxes or concentrates, the AirVape X guarantees truly brilliant performance at all times. Featuring an in-built hybrid heating system that makes use of both convection and conduction heating methods, the AirVape X ensures every single part of your chosen material is evenly heated. Providing delicious-tasting vapour filled with authentic flavour, this vape’s dual-filter cooling system helps produce silky smooth vapour clouds every time.
25% Bigger Herb Chamber
Offering a larger herb chamber than its predecessor, the AirVape Xs, the AirVape X provides more capacity for even longer sessions to be enjoyed. And due to the larger, more expansive size of the bowl, it makes cleaning and maintenance much easier.
Easy to Use with Full Temperature Control
As the AirVape X can be used to vaporize dry herbs, oils, waves and concentrates, it makes sense to assume its operation would be complicated. But that couldn’t be further from the truth! Featuring just one power button and two convenient temperature control buttons, this vape is effortlessly simple – perfect for beginners.
Also offering the ability to select whichever degree you want between 93°C and 220°C, you have full control over the temperature of your sessions. The useful LED display provides accurate temperature readings at all times, and you can even switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit dependent on your preference.
Powerful Battery
The AirVape X battery requires just one hour to become fully charged, meaning you certainly won’t have to wait long to get a session underway. And as it’s chargeable via USB, you can easily charge this vape whilst on-the-go provided you have access to a USB port.
The AirVape X can easily withstand most session lengths with ease. But if you find the battery begins to diminish before your session is over, this device can still be used while being charged due to its pass-through charging technology.
Warranty
The AirVape X comes with a 2-year warranty by MagicVaporizers and an additional limited lifetime warranty through the manufacturer.

Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first.

Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

Who is the PAX Plus for?
Over the last decade, PAX Labs has become known for efficient and durable conduction heated vaporizers and the PAX Plus is no exception. The PAX Plus has the same iconic and minimalistic design as previous PAX models, with no buttons on the surface except for the four petal-shaped LEDs on the front and the magnetic charging connector at the back.
If you're someone who appreciates the combination of portability and discreetness, you are also going to enjoy the PAX Plus as it's just under 10 centimetres tall and easily conceals in the palm or pocket.
Tasty vapour in under 30 seconds
The vapour produced by the PAX Plus’s conduction heating is consistently potent and flavourful, and as it heats up in under 30 seconds, you can get your sessions started quickly.
Even though the vapour quality is not as good as you can get from a larger vape (such as the Mighty Plus or Tinymight 2), the PAX Plus easily outperforms most smaller-sized vaporizers.
New vape experience modes
Unlike traditional vaporizers where you set the temperature manually, the PAX Plus instead has four unique experience modes; Stealth, Efficiency, Flavour and Boost.
To change the mode, just hold the button until the lights (petals) change to match the mode you want.
Stealth mode (one lit petal) is for those times you need to be discreet. When this mode is active, the LEDs are dimmed and the heating is adjusted to minimise visible vapour.
Efficiency mode (two lit petals) on the other hand is for those slow and relaxing sessions. This mode is meant to extract your herbs fully but at a slow pace.
Flavour mode (three lit petals) delivers the strongest taste of all modes. If you enjoy the subtle flavour differences between your herb strains then this mode was made for you.
Boost mode (four lit petals) is for intense and fast sessions. This mode reaches the higher temperatures that are needed for maximum vapour production. It's also this mode that works best with concentrates using the concentrate insert.
Adjustable oven size
With the PAX Plus you can adjust the oven size as it includes two types of oven lids. The standard oven lid is perfect for when you want to pack a full oven (0,5g) for a long session or for sharing with friends.
The half oven lid allows you to shrink the oven to half the normal size, perfect for microdosing and conserving your herbs. The lids are magnetic, which ensures they stay securely in place during use.
Smart standby mode
Unlike most dry herb vaporizers that time your sessions for only five minutes before automatically shutting off, the PAX Plus allows you to enjoy your session for as long as you want thanks to lip-sensing technology and the built-in accelerometer.
If you happen to forget to turn off the PAX Plus after you're done you still don't have to worry though. If the vape is left inactive, it will automatically enter standby mode, indicated by blue pulsing lights. After one minute of inactivity, the heater will disengage, and after two more minutes of inactivity, it will turn off.
Two different mouthpieces
The PAX Plus comes with two mouthpiece options: a flat mouthpiece and a raised mouthpiece. The flat mouthpiece is even with the top of the device and has a small slit where you can put your lips to inhale.
The raised mouthpiece is designed to deliver smoother and cooler vapour. Most users find it more comfortable to use, but it reduces the vapour production slightly.
Both for dry herbs and concentrates
The PAX Plus is a versatile vape that allows you to use both dry herbs and concentrates. With the included concentrate insert, you can easily switch between dry herbs and concentrates without having to switch vapes.
However, it's worth noting that while the PAX Plus is capable of vaporizing concentrates, there are better-suited vapes for it. If you only use concentrates occasionally then the PAX Plus capabilities will be enough, but if you like to enjoy concentrates often we recommended using a vape specifically designed for concentrates.
Up to 2 hours of battery
The PAX Plus comes equipped with a built-in 3300 mAh battery that provides up to two hours of session time at the lowest experience mode (stealth) on a full charge. If you prefer the more intense experience modes, the session time will be reduced according to the mode.
When it’s time to charge, all you have to do is plug in the cable and attach the magnetic charging dock to the back of the PAX Plus. The charge time from an empty to a full battery is between two and three hours.
Less maintenance
Compared to previous released PAX vapes, the PAX Plus has been made easier to clean, allowing you to spend more time enjoying your vaporizer and less time on maintenance. This is mostly thanks to the updated 3D oven screen that both improves the airflow and is easier to remove for deep-cleaning.
To help keep the oven clean a cleaning brush and the redesigned multi-tool that is great for packing and removing material from the ovens of PAX Plus and PAX Mini.
Warranty
All PAX Plus vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of PAX Labs products, are authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

These vinyl PAX Caps by Delta 3D Studios are the perfect size to slide over both ends of the PAX Vaporizer to hide odours and act as shock bumpers for light falls. The caps will not interfere with charging the vaporizer, but they can not be used while the PAX vape is running.
Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first. However, the vinyl will stretch with time (you can also use a hair dryer to soften the vinyl before initially putting on). Caps will be much easier to put on/off after a few weeks of use. Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

Who is the PAX Plus for?
Over the last decade, PAX Labs has become known for efficient and durable conduction heated vaporizers and the PAX Plus is no exception. The PAX Plus has the same iconic and minimalistic design as previous PAX models, with no buttons on the surface except for the four petal-shaped LEDs on the front and the magnetic charging connector at the back.
If you're someone who appreciates the combination of portability and discreetness, you are also going to enjoy the PAX Plus as it's just under 10 centimetres tall and easily conceals in the palm or pocket.
Tasty vapour in under 30 seconds
The vapour produced by the PAX Plus’s conduction heating is consistently potent and flavourful, and as it heats up in under 30 seconds, you can get your sessions started quickly.
Even though the vapour quality is not as good as you can get from a larger vape (such as the Mighty Plus or Tinymight 2), the PAX Plus easily outperforms most smaller-sized vaporizers.
New vape experience modes
Unlike traditional vaporizers where you set the temperature manually, the PAX Plus instead has four unique experience modes; Stealth, Efficiency, Flavour and Boost.
To change the mode, just hold the button until the lights (petals) change to match the mode you want.
Stealth mode (one lit petal) is for those times you need to be discreet. When this mode is active, the LEDs are dimmed and the heating is adjusted to minimise visible vapour.
Efficiency mode (two lit petals) on the other hand is for those slow and relaxing sessions. This mode is meant to extract your herbs fully but at a slow pace.
Flavour mode (three lit petals) delivers the strongest taste of all modes. If you enjoy the subtle flavour differences between your herb strains then this mode was made for you.
Boost mode (four lit petals) is for intense and fast sessions. This mode reaches the higher temperatures that are needed for maximum vapour production. It's also this mode that works best with concentrates using the concentrate insert.
Adjustable oven size
With the PAX Plus you can adjust the oven size as it includes two types of oven lids. The standard oven lid is perfect for when you want to pack a full oven (0,5g) for a long session or for sharing with friends.
The half oven lid allows you to shrink the oven to half the normal size, perfect for microdosing and conserving your herbs. The lids are magnetic, which ensures they stay securely in place during use.
Smart standby mode
Unlike most dry herb vaporizers that time your sessions for only five minutes before automatically shutting off, the PAX Plus allows you to enjoy your session for as long as you want thanks to lip-sensing technology and the built-in accelerometer.
If you happen to forget to turn off the PAX Plus after you're done you still don't have to worry though. If the vape is left inactive, it will automatically enter standby mode, indicated by blue pulsing lights. After one minute of inactivity, the heater will disengage, and after two more minutes of inactivity, it will turn off.
Two different mouthpieces
The PAX Plus comes with two mouthpiece options: a flat mouthpiece and a raised mouthpiece. The flat mouthpiece is even with the top of the device and has a small slit where you can put your lips to inhale.
The raised mouthpiece is designed to deliver smoother and cooler vapour. Most users find it more comfortable to use, but it reduces the vapour production slightly.
Both for dry herbs and concentrates
The PAX Plus is a versatile vape that allows you to use both dry herbs and concentrates. With the included concentrate insert, you can easily switch between dry herbs and concentrates without having to switch vapes.
However, it's worth noting that while the PAX Plus is capable of vaporizing concentrates, there are better-suited vapes for it. If you only use concentrates occasionally then the PAX Plus capabilities will be enough, but if you like to enjoy concentrates often we recommended using a vape specifically designed for concentrates.
Up to 2 hours of battery
The PAX Plus comes equipped with a built-in 3300 mAh battery that provides up to two hours of session time at the lowest experience mode (stealth) on a full charge. If you prefer the more intense experience modes, the session time will be reduced according to the mode.
When it’s time to charge, all you have to do is plug in the cable and attach the magnetic charging dock to the back of the PAX Plus. The charge time from an empty to a full battery is between two and three hours.
Less maintenance
Compared to previous released PAX vapes, the PAX Plus has been made easier to clean, allowing you to spend more time enjoying your vaporizer and less time on maintenance. This is mostly thanks to the updated 3D oven screen that both improves the airflow and is easier to remove for deep-cleaning.
To help keep the oven clean a cleaning brush and the redesigned multi-tool that is great for packing and removing material from the ovens of PAX Plus and PAX Mini.
Warranty
All PAX Plus vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of PAX Labs products, are authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

These vinyl PAX Caps by Delta 3D Studios are the perfect size to slide over both ends of the PAX Vaporizer to hide odours and act as shock bumpers for light falls. The caps will not interfere with charging the vaporizer, but they can not be used while the PAX vape is running.
Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first. However, the vinyl will stretch with time (you can also use a hair dryer to soften the vinyl before initially putting on). Caps will be much easier to put on/off after a few weeks of use. Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

Who is the PAX Plus for?
Over the last decade, PAX Labs has become known for efficient and durable conduction heated vaporizers and the PAX Plus is no exception. The PAX Plus has the same iconic and minimalistic design as previous PAX models, with no buttons on the surface except for the four petal-shaped LEDs on the front and the magnetic charging connector at the back.
If you're someone who appreciates the combination of portability and discreetness, you are also going to enjoy the PAX Plus as it's just under 10 centimetres tall and easily conceals in the palm or pocket.
Tasty vapour in under 30 seconds
The vapour produced by the PAX Plus’s conduction heating is consistently potent and flavourful, and as it heats up in under 30 seconds, you can get your sessions started quickly.
Even though the vapour quality is not as good as you can get from a larger vape (such as the Mighty Plus or Tinymight 2), the PAX Plus easily outperforms most smaller-sized vaporizers.
New vape experience modes
Unlike traditional vaporizers where you set the temperature manually, the PAX Plus instead has four unique experience modes; Stealth, Efficiency, Flavour and Boost.
To change the mode, just hold the button until the lights (petals) change to match the mode you want.
Stealth mode (one lit petal) is for those times you need to be discreet. When this mode is active, the LEDs are dimmed and the heating is adjusted to minimise visible vapour.
Efficiency mode (two lit petals) on the other hand is for those slow and relaxing sessions. This mode is meant to extract your herbs fully but at a slow pace.
Flavour mode (three lit petals) delivers the strongest taste of all modes. If you enjoy the subtle flavour differences between your herb strains then this mode was made for you.
Boost mode (four lit petals) is for intense and fast sessions. This mode reaches the higher temperatures that are needed for maximum vapour production. It's also this mode that works best with concentrates using the concentrate insert.
Adjustable oven size
With the PAX Plus you can adjust the oven size as it includes two types of oven lids. The standard oven lid is perfect for when you want to pack a full oven (0,5g) for a long session or for sharing with friends.
The half oven lid allows you to shrink the oven to half the normal size, perfect for microdosing and conserving your herbs. The lids are magnetic, which ensures they stay securely in place during use.
Smart standby mode
Unlike most dry herb vaporizers that time your sessions for only five minutes before automatically shutting off, the PAX Plus allows you to enjoy your session for as long as you want thanks to lip-sensing technology and the built-in accelerometer.
If you happen to forget to turn off the PAX Plus after you're done you still don't have to worry though. If the vape is left inactive, it will automatically enter standby mode, indicated by blue pulsing lights. After one minute of inactivity, the heater will disengage, and after two more minutes of inactivity, it will turn off.
Two different mouthpieces
The PAX Plus comes with two mouthpiece options: a flat mouthpiece and a raised mouthpiece. The flat mouthpiece is even with the top of the device and has a small slit where you can put your lips to inhale.
The raised mouthpiece is designed to deliver smoother and cooler vapour. Most users find it more comfortable to use, but it reduces the vapour production slightly.
Both for dry herbs and concentrates
The PAX Plus is a versatile vape that allows you to use both dry herbs and concentrates. With the included concentrate insert, you can easily switch between dry herbs and concentrates without having to switch vapes.
However, it's worth noting that while the PAX Plus is capable of vaporizing concentrates, there are better-suited vapes for it. If you only use concentrates occasionally then the PAX Plus capabilities will be enough, but if you like to enjoy concentrates often we recommended using a vape specifically designed for concentrates.
Up to 2 hours of battery
The PAX Plus comes equipped with a built-in 3300 mAh battery that provides up to two hours of session time at the lowest experience mode (stealth) on a full charge. If you prefer the more intense experience modes, the session time will be reduced according to the mode.
When it’s time to charge, all you have to do is plug in the cable and attach the magnetic charging dock to the back of the PAX Plus. The charge time from an empty to a full battery is between two and three hours.
Less maintenance
Compared to previous released PAX vapes, the PAX Plus has been made easier to clean, allowing you to spend more time enjoying your vaporizer and less time on maintenance. This is mostly thanks to the updated 3D oven screen that both improves the airflow and is easier to remove for deep-cleaning.
To help keep the oven clean a cleaning brush and the redesigned multi-tool that is great for packing and removing material from the ovens of PAX Plus and PAX Mini.
Warranty
All PAX Plus vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of PAX Labs products, are authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

These vinyl PAX Caps by Delta 3D Studios are the perfect size to slide over both ends of the PAX Vaporizer to hide odours and act as shock bumpers for light falls. The caps will not interfere with charging the vaporizer, but they can not be used while the PAX vape is running.
Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first. However, the vinyl will stretch with time (you can also use a hair dryer to soften the vinyl before initially putting on). Caps will be much easier to put on/off after a few weeks of use. Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

It includes a large collapsible silicone bowl that, when expanded, provides a spill-safe area for weighing your material and when the bowl is collapsed it can be latched with a lid to keep the scale safe from knocks.
The results are easy to read from the extra-large LCD with pink backlight and the built-in overload protection helps prevent damage to the scale. Other features include automatic piece counting, power-saving auto-off after 3 minutes of inactivity, tare/zero feature for subtracting the weight of a container or expansion tray, and easy one-touch calibration.

Who is the PAX Plus for?
Over the last decade, PAX Labs has become known for efficient and durable conduction heated vaporizers and the PAX Plus is no exception. The PAX Plus has the same iconic and minimalistic design as previous PAX models, with no buttons on the surface except for the four petal-shaped LEDs on the front and the magnetic charging connector at the back.
If you're someone who appreciates the combination of portability and discreetness, you are also going to enjoy the PAX Plus as it's just under 10 centimetres tall and easily conceals in the palm or pocket.
Tasty vapour in under 30 seconds
The vapour produced by the PAX Plus’s conduction heating is consistently potent and flavourful, and as it heats up in under 30 seconds, you can get your sessions started quickly.
Even though the vapour quality is not as good as you can get from a larger vape (such as the Mighty Plus or Tinymight 2), the PAX Plus easily outperforms most smaller-sized vaporizers.
New vape experience modes
Unlike traditional vaporizers where you set the temperature manually, the PAX Plus instead has four unique experience modes; Stealth, Efficiency, Flavour and Boost.
To change the mode, just hold the button until the lights (petals) change to match the mode you want.
Stealth mode (one lit petal) is for those times you need to be discreet. When this mode is active, the LEDs are dimmed and the heating is adjusted to minimise visible vapour.
Efficiency mode (two lit petals) on the other hand is for those slow and relaxing sessions. This mode is meant to extract your herbs fully but at a slow pace.
Flavour mode (three lit petals) delivers the strongest taste of all modes. If you enjoy the subtle flavour differences between your herb strains then this mode was made for you.
Boost mode (four lit petals) is for intense and fast sessions. This mode reaches the higher temperatures that are needed for maximum vapour production. It's also this mode that works best with concentrates using the concentrate insert.
Adjustable oven size
With the PAX Plus you can adjust the oven size as it includes two types of oven lids. The standard oven lid is perfect for when you want to pack a full oven (0,5g) for a long session or for sharing with friends.
The half oven lid allows you to shrink the oven to half the normal size, perfect for microdosing and conserving your herbs. The lids are magnetic, which ensures they stay securely in place during use.
Smart standby mode
Unlike most dry herb vaporizers that time your sessions for only five minutes before automatically shutting off, the PAX Plus allows you to enjoy your session for as long as you want thanks to lip-sensing technology and the built-in accelerometer.
If you happen to forget to turn off the PAX Plus after you're done you still don't have to worry though. If the vape is left inactive, it will automatically enter standby mode, indicated by blue pulsing lights. After one minute of inactivity, the heater will disengage, and after two more minutes of inactivity, it will turn off.
Two different mouthpieces
The PAX Plus comes with two mouthpiece options: a flat mouthpiece and a raised mouthpiece. The flat mouthpiece is even with the top of the device and has a small slit where you can put your lips to inhale.
The raised mouthpiece is designed to deliver smoother and cooler vapour. Most users find it more comfortable to use, but it reduces the vapour production slightly.
Both for dry herbs and concentrates
The PAX Plus is a versatile vape that allows you to use both dry herbs and concentrates. With the included concentrate insert, you can easily switch between dry herbs and concentrates without having to switch vapes.
However, it's worth noting that while the PAX Plus is capable of vaporizing concentrates, there are better-suited vapes for it. If you only use concentrates occasionally then the PAX Plus capabilities will be enough, but if you like to enjoy concentrates often we recommended using a vape specifically designed for concentrates.
Up to 2 hours of battery
The PAX Plus comes equipped with a built-in 3300 mAh battery that provides up to two hours of session time at the lowest experience mode (stealth) on a full charge. If you prefer the more intense experience modes, the session time will be reduced according to the mode.
When it’s time to charge, all you have to do is plug in the cable and attach the magnetic charging dock to the back of the PAX Plus. The charge time from an empty to a full battery is between two and three hours.
Less maintenance
Compared to previous released PAX vapes, the PAX Plus has been made easier to clean, allowing you to spend more time enjoying your vaporizer and less time on maintenance. This is mostly thanks to the updated 3D oven screen that both improves the airflow and is easier to remove for deep-cleaning.
To help keep the oven clean a cleaning brush and the redesigned multi-tool that is great for packing and removing material from the ovens of PAX Plus and PAX Mini.
Warranty

These vinyl PAX Caps by Delta 3D Studios are the perfect size to slide over both ends of the PAX Vaporizer to hide odours and act as shock bumpers for light falls. The caps will not interfere with charging the vaporizer, but they can not be used while the PAX vape is running.
Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first. However, the vinyl will stretch with time (you can also use a hair dryer to soften the vinyl before initially putting on). Caps will be much easier to put on/off after a few weeks of use. Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

Who is the PAX Plus for?
Over the last decade, PAX Labs has become known for efficient and durable conduction heated vaporizers and the PAX Plus is no exception. The PAX Plus has the same iconic and minimalistic design as previous PAX models, with no buttons on the surface except for the four petal-shaped LEDs on the front and the magnetic charging connector at the back.
If you're someone who appreciates the combination of portability and discreetness, you are also going to enjoy the PAX Plus as it's just under 10 centimetres tall and easily conceals in the palm or pocket.
Tasty vapour in under 30 seconds
The vapour produced by the PAX Plus’s conduction heating is consistently potent and flavourful, and as it heats up in under 30 seconds, you can get your sessions started quickly.
Even though the vapour quality is not as good as you can get from a larger vape (such as the Mighty Plus or Tinymight 2), the PAX Plus easily outperforms most smaller-sized vaporizers.
New vape experience modes
Unlike traditional vaporizers where you set the temperature manually, the PAX Plus instead has four unique experience modes; Stealth, Efficiency, Flavour and Boost.
To change the mode, just hold the button until the lights (petals) change to match the mode you want.
Stealth mode (one lit petal) is for those times you need to be discreet. When this mode is active, the LEDs are dimmed and the heating is adjusted to minimise visible vapour.
Efficiency mode (two lit petals) on the other hand is for those slow and relaxing sessions. This mode is meant to extract your herbs fully but at a slow pace.
Flavour mode (three lit petals) delivers the strongest taste of all modes. If you enjoy the subtle flavour differences between your herb strains then this mode was made for you.
Boost mode (four lit petals) is for intense and fast sessions. This mode reaches the higher temperatures that are needed for maximum vapour production. It's also this mode that works best with concentrates using the concentrate insert.
Adjustable oven size
With the PAX Plus you can adjust the oven size as it includes two types of oven lids. The standard oven lid is perfect for when you want to pack a full oven (0,5g) for a long session or for sharing with friends.
The half oven lid allows you to shrink the oven to half the normal size, perfect for microdosing and conserving your herbs. The lids are magnetic, which ensures they stay securely in place during use.
Smart standby mode
Unlike most dry herb vaporizers that time your sessions for only five minutes before automatically shutting off, the PAX Plus allows you to enjoy your session for as long as you want thanks to lip-sensing technology and the built-in accelerometer.
If you happen to forget to turn off the PAX Plus after you're done you still don't have to worry though. If the vape is left inactive, it will automatically enter standby mode, indicated by blue pulsing lights. After one minute of inactivity, the heater will disengage, and after two more minutes of inactivity, it will turn off.
Two different mouthpieces
The PAX Plus comes with two mouthpiece options: a flat mouthpiece and a raised mouthpiece. The flat mouthpiece is even with the top of the device and has a small slit where you can put your lips to inhale.
The raised mouthpiece is designed to deliver smoother and cooler vapour. Most users find it more comfortable to use, but it reduces the vapour production slightly.
Both for dry herbs and concentrates
The PAX Plus is a versatile vape that allows you to use both dry herbs and concentrates. With the included concentrate insert, you can easily switch between dry herbs and concentrates without having to switch vapes.
However, it's worth noting that while the PAX Plus is capable of vaporizing concentrates, there are better-suited vapes for it. If you only use concentrates occasionally then the PAX Plus capabilities will be enough, but if you like to enjoy concentrates often we recommended using a vape specifically designed for concentrates.
Up to 2 hours of battery
The PAX Plus comes equipped with a built-in 3300 mAh battery that provides up to two hours of session time at the lowest experience mode (stealth) on a full charge. If you prefer the more intense experience modes, the session time will be reduced according to the mode.
When it’s time to charge, all you have to do is plug in the cable and attach the magnetic charging dock to the back of the PAX Plus. The charge time from an empty to a full battery is between two and three hours.
Less maintenance
Compared to previous released PAX vapes, the PAX Plus has been made easier to clean, allowing you to spend more time enjoying your vaporizer and less time on maintenance. This is mostly thanks to the updated 3D oven screen that both improves the airflow and is easier to remove for deep-cleaning.
To help keep the oven clean a cleaning brush and the redesigned multi-tool that is great for packing and removing material from the ovens of PAX Plus and PAX Mini.
Warranty
All PAX Plus vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of PAX Labs products, are authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

These vinyl PAX Caps by Delta 3D Studios are the perfect size to slide over both ends of the PAX Vaporizer to hide odours and act as shock bumpers for light falls. The caps will not interfere with charging the vaporizer, but they can not be used while the PAX vape is running.
Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first. However, the vinyl will stretch with time (you can also use a hair dryer to soften the vinyl before initially putting on). Caps will be much easier to put on/off after a few weeks of use. Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

Who is the PAX Mini for?
If you are new to dry herbs vaping and want a simple but reliable vape to get started, the PAX Mini is the perfect choice for you. All there is to do is pack the oven with herbs, press the button and wait around 30 seconds before you can enjoy the flavourful vapour.
The PAX Mini adjusts the temperature to your style of inhaling, so you don't have to worry about settings or complicated functions. It's also incredibly durable and easy to maintain with the new 3D screen, which means you can spend less time cleaning and more time enjoying your vape sessions.
Ultra-portable
The PAX Mini is designed to be ultra-portable, with a sleek and modern design that matches the latest smartphones. It measures just 3.1 × 2.2 × 9.3 centimetres and weighs 89 grams, which means that it fits comfortably in your pocket or bag.
Many sessions per charge
With a single charge, the built-in battery of the PAX Mini lasts up to two hours, enough for approximately 10 sessions.
Quick heat-up time
The PAX Mini uses conduction heat to vaporize the herbs. Conduction heating means that the herbs are heated by direct contact with the hot oven walls, a process that takes about 30 seconds. /p>
Ideal for solo users
With a capacity of approximately 0.25 grams, the PAX Mini’s oven is perfectly sized for solo use. The oven’s magnetic lid keeps your herbs securely in place and prevents accidental spills during use and when it’s being transported.
One heat setting
The PAX Mini has only one heat setting that adjusts to your vaping style. It starts at the same temperature for each session but adjusts the heat based on how you inhale the vapour to give you a consistent vaping experience.
Very simple to use
All you have to do is pack the PAX Mini's oven with herbs, press the button, wait for the light to turn green and then you can enjoy the vapour. When you’re done, click the button again to shut it off.
Smart features
With the PAX Mini’s smart features, you won’t have to worry about accidentally leaving it on and draining the battery. The accelerometer detects movement, while the lip sensor knows when you inhale, and after a minute of inactivity, the PAX Mini goes into standby mode. Wait another minute and it will shut down altogether.
Improved oven screen
The PAX Mini features an improved 3D oven screen that allows for better airflow and easy removal for cleaning. The screen ensures that your dry herbs are heated evenly for a smooth and flavourful vapour.
Two mouthpieces included
With the PAX Mini, you get two mouthpiece options to choose from. The flat mouthpiece is discreet and fits evenly with the top of the device, while the raised mouthpiece offers more comfort and cooler vapour.
USB charging dock
The 3000 mAh built-in battery takes approximately 2.5 hours to charge. You charge it by connecting the magnetic USB charging dock to the back of the vape.
PAX Mini vs PAX Plus
The PAX Mini and PAX Plus both share the iconic PAX design and feature a single-button setup. However, the PAX Mini is a smaller, simpler version with a smaller oven and only one session mode, while the PAX Plus has a larger oven, four experience modes, and more accessories.

Easy cleaning

These vinyl PAX Caps by Delta 3D Studios are the perfect size to slide over both ends of the PAX Vaporizer to hide odours and act as shock bumpers for light falls. The caps will not interfere with charging the vaporizer, but they can not be used while the PAX vape is running.
Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first. However, the vinyl will stretch with time (you can also use a hair dryer to soften the vinyl before initially putting on). Caps will be much easier to put on/off after a few weeks of use. Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

Who is the PAX Mini for?
If you are new to dry herbs vaping and want a simple but reliable vape to get started, the PAX Mini is the perfect choice for you. All there is to do is pack the oven with herbs, press the button and wait around 30 seconds before you can enjoy the flavourful vapour.
The PAX Mini adjusts the temperature to your style of inhaling, so you don't have to worry about settings or complicated functions. It's also incredibly durable and easy to maintain with the new 3D screen, which means you can spend less time cleaning and more time enjoying your vape sessions.
Ultra-portable
The PAX Mini is designed to be ultra-portable, with a sleek and modern design that matches the latest smartphones. It measures just 3.1 × 2.2 × 9.3 centimetres and weighs 89 grams, which means that it fits comfortably in your pocket or bag.
Many sessions per charge
With a single charge, the built-in battery of the PAX Mini lasts up to two hours, enough for approximately 10 sessions.
Quick heat-up time
The PAX Mini uses conduction heat to vaporize the herbs. Conduction heating means that the herbs are heated by direct contact with the hot oven walls, a process that takes about 30 seconds. /p>
Ideal for solo users
With a capacity of approximately 0.25 grams, the PAX Mini’s oven is perfectly sized for solo use. The oven’s magnetic lid keeps your herbs securely in place and prevents accidental spills during use and when it’s being transported.
One heat setting
The PAX Mini has only one heat setting that adjusts to your vaping style. It starts at the same temperature for each session but adjusts the heat based on how you inhale the vapour to give you a consistent vaping experience.
Very simple to use
All you have to do is pack the PAX Mini's oven with herbs, press the button, wait for the light to turn green and then you can enjoy the vapour. When you’re done, click the button again to shut it off.
Smart features
With the PAX Mini’s smart features, you won’t have to worry about accidentally leaving it on and draining the battery. The accelerometer detects movement, while the lip sensor knows when you inhale, and after a minute of inactivity, the PAX Mini goes into standby mode. Wait another minute and it will shut down altogether.
Improved oven screen
The PAX Mini features an improved 3D oven screen that allows for better airflow and easy removal for cleaning. The screen ensures that your dry herbs are heated evenly for a smooth and flavourful vapour.
Two mouthpieces included
With the PAX Mini, you get two mouthpiece options to choose from. The flat mouthpiece is discreet and fits evenly with the top of the device, while the raised mouthpiece offers more comfort and cooler vapour.
USB charging dock
The 3000 mAh built-in battery takes approximately 2.5 hours to charge. You charge it by connecting the magnetic USB charging dock to the back of the vape.
PAX Mini vs PAX Plus
The PAX Mini and PAX Plus both share the iconic PAX design and feature a single-button setup. However, the PAX Mini is a smaller, simpler version with a smaller oven and only one session mode, while the PAX Plus has a larger oven, four experience modes, and more accessories.
Warranty
All PAX Mini vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorized distributor of PAX Labs products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Low effort
The Premium Grinder is easy to use, with a magnetic closure on the top lid and with a  lower collector that only requires a quarter-turn for effortless removal.

Easy cleaning
Fully disassemble all parts for complete access and thorough cleaning.
Swappable screens

These vinyl PAX Caps by Delta 3D Studios are the perfect size to slide over both ends of the PAX Vaporizer to hide odours and act as shock bumpers for light falls. The caps will not interfere with charging the vaporizer, but they can not be used while the PAX vape is running.
Note that caps will have a tight fit and might be difficult to put on at first. However, the vinyl will stretch with time (you can also use a hair dryer to soften the vinyl before initially putting on). Caps will be much easier to put on/off after a few weeks of use. Do NOT clean with isopropyl alcohol as prolonged exposure can damage the vinyl.

Who is the PAX Mini for?
If you are new to dry herbs vaping and want a simple but reliable vape to get started, the PAX Mini is the perfect choice for you. All there is to do is pack the oven with herbs, press the button and wait around 30 seconds before you can enjoy the flavourful vapour.
The PAX Mini adjusts the temperature to your style of inhaling, so you don't have to worry about settings or complicated functions. It's also incredibly durable and easy to maintain with the new 3D screen, which means you can spend less time cleaning and more time enjoying your vape sessions.
Ultra-portable
The PAX Mini is designed to be ultra-portable, with a sleek and modern design that matches the latest smartphones. It measures just 3.1 × 2.2 × 9.3 centimetres and weighs 89 grams, which means that it fits comfortably in your pocket or bag.
Many sessions per charge
With a single charge, the built-in battery of the PAX Mini lasts up to two hours, enough for approximately 10 sessions.
Quick heat-up time
The PAX Mini uses conduction heat to vaporize the herbs. Conduction heating means that the herbs are heated by direct contact with the hot oven walls, a process that takes about 30 seconds. /p>
Ideal for solo users
With a capacity of approximately 0.25 grams, the PAX Mini’s oven is perfectly sized for solo use. The oven’s magnetic lid keeps your herbs securely in place and prevents accidental spills during use and when it’s being transported.
One heat setting
The PAX Mini has only one heat setting that adjusts to your vaping style. It starts at the same temperature for each session but adjusts the heat based on how you inhale the vapour to give you a consistent vaping experience.
Very simple to use
All you have to do is pack the PAX Mini's oven with herbs, press the button, wait for the light to turn green and then you can enjoy the vapour. When you’re done, click the button again to shut it off.
Smart features
With the PAX Mini’s smart features, you won’t have to worry about accidentally leaving it on and draining the battery. The accelerometer detects movement, while the lip sensor knows when you inhale, and after a minute of inactivity, the PAX Mini goes into standby mode. Wait another minute and it will shut down altogether.
Improved oven screen
The PAX Mini features an improved 3D oven screen that allows for better airflow and easy removal for cleaning. The screen ensures that your dry herbs are heated evenly for a smooth and flavourful vapour.
Two mouthpieces included
With the PAX Mini, you get two mouthpiece options to choose from. The flat mouthpiece is discreet and fits evenly with the top of the device, while the raised mouthpiece offers more comfort and cooler vapour.
USB charging dock
The 3000 mAh built-in battery takes approximately 2.5 hours to charge. You charge it by connecting the magnetic USB charging dock to the back of the vape.
PAX Mini vs PAX Plus
The PAX Mini and PAX Plus both share the iconic PAX design and feature a single-button setup. However, the PAX Mini is a smaller, simpler version with a smaller oven and only one session mode, while the PAX Plus has a larger oven, four experience modes, and more accessories.
Warranty
All PAX Mini vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorized distributor of PAX Labs products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Fully insulated air path
Comfortable to hold and easy to use
Zirconium mouthpiece
Large titanium heating chamber

Who is the Fenix NEO for?
The Fenix NEO is perfect for those who are looking for a convection-heated and reliable dry herb vaporizer. Its wide temperature range, adjustable session time, and degree-accurate temperature control make it a great choice for those who want full control over the heating process.
Pure vapour with convection heating
With 100% convection heating and an insulated air duct, the Fenix NEO vaporizer offers a highly efficient and pure method of vaporizing dry herbs. Convection heating means that hot air is lead through the chamber which causes the herbs to heat and produce flavourful vapour without any combustion.
Comfortable to hold and easy to use
The Fenix NEO has a sleek and ergonomic design that makes it easy to use and comfortable to hold. Its rubber-coated outer provides a pleasant and cool touch, while its compact size allows it to fit comfortably in your hand. It also features a magnetic mouthpiece of zirconium that can both be removed and folded in for convenient storage, ensuring that it stays clean and protected when not in use.
In terms of usability, the Fenix NEO is designed to be simple and intuitive, with just three buttons that are easy to use thanks to the large OLED display. The device also features haptic feedback, which means it vibrates when you turn it on or off, or when it reaches the desired temperature.
Large titanium chamber
The chamber of the Fenix NEO is made of titanium, a material known for its strength and durability. The chamber is 12 mm in height and diameter so you can fit up to 0.25 grams of herbs in it, which is above average for a portable vape.
Full temperature control and fast heating
Temperature control is crucial to get the most out of your herbs, and the Fenix NEO excels in this area as the temperature can be easily adjusted with a single degree accuracy between 120°C to 210°. This means you can start slow at low temperatures to enjoy the flavour, and then raise the temperature to fully extract your herbs later on.
You don’t have to wait long for the Fenix NEO to heat up and it’s ready to heat your herbs in under 30 seconds. If you want to get even thicker vapour, we recommended waiting a bit longer after the vibration to make sure the heat will be optimal.
Large OLED display
The Fenix NEO vaporizer is equipped with a large, OLED display that makes it easy to adjust the temperature, set the timer, and check the battery level. The upper area of the display shows the set and actual temperature, while the lower area displays the session timer with the set and actual time as well as the battery level.
Adjustable session timer
The adjustable session timer on the Fenix NEO allows users to control the time with precision by setting the session time between 3-7 minutes. Once the session timer runs out, the unit will automatically shut off to ensure no battery is being wasted. If you need more time, you can easily refresh the timer.
Powerful battery with USB-C charging
The Fenix NEO boasts a powerful built-in 3000 mAh battery, which is more than enough for several extended vaping sessions. The battery is rechargeable through USB-C, which enables fast charging and ensures that it can be charged from many power sources.
Removable stirring tool
At the bottom of the Fenix NEO there is a removable stirring tool that makes it easy to mix the herbs in the chamber wherever you are. The stirring tool can also effectively be used to clean the chamber of vaped herbs and residue.
Warranty
All Fenix NEO vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Fenix, are completely authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty.

Who is the AirVape Legacy Pro for?
Looking for a vaporizer that does it all? You might just have found it in the AirVape Legacy Pro. Its capability of delivering world-class hybrid heating, ultra-fast heat-up time, wireless charging and concentrate mode is guaranteed to impress even the most experienced vape enthusiast.
The team behind AirVape took a long look at the feedback received from the users of the original Legacy and meticulously improved a long list of things, including the heating technology, airflow and chamber size. With these improvements and some new features, the Legacy Pro is ready to battle for the first place of portable vaporizers.
Even better looking
The Legacy was already a great-looking vape, but the Legacy Pro is even more stylish and slightly lighter. The shape is similar, but the edges have been curved for a more sophisticated look and the matte black finish now features a gold accent on the front, representing the AirVape logo.
Not only does the Legacy Pro have a premium look, but thanks to the combination of black textile and leather, they have also considered the environmental aspects as the textile is hemp-based and the leather is vegan.
New heating technology
With the AirVape Legacy Pro, you get the best of both worlds as it utilises both convection and conduction heating. The convection heat is still the same as in the original Legacy, but they have also added conduction heat by applying direct heating at the gold-plated heating chamber. This means more efficient herb extraction and faster heating.
It takes less than 15 seconds to reach vapour temperatures which will be indicated by a vibration. You can set the temperature with a 1-degree precision from 93°C to 227°C so you can always find the perfect temperature matching whatever you’re in the mood to vaporize.
“On-demand” mode
When the “On-Demand” mode is switched on, the chamber is being heated only when the power button is pushed, and the temperature drops as soon as the button is released. This way the active ingredients are only being extracted when you are activating the heating and thus preventing the herbs from being wasted.
This mode is also helpful for users that prefer a higher temperature setting, but with a shorter period of heat. While in “On-Demand” mode, you have full control over how many seconds you allow the herbs to be actively heated.
Improved airflow
The most common complaint of the original Legacy was about the airflow, so it’s no surprise that has been the biggest priority for AirVape to improve upon. After thorough testing, we can confirm that the airflow resistance of the Legacy Pro is now minimal and the new closing mechanism helps to better isolate the air path.
20% bigger chamber
With a higher heat efficiency and better airflow, AirVape also took the opportunity to increase the chamber size of the Legacy Pro by 20%. This means you can now have longer sessions by yourself, or more easily share when your friends inevitably want to give this premium vape a try.
Great for microdosing
If you enjoy microdosing or simply just prefer using smaller quantities of herb then you will appreciate the Legacy Pro’s built-in and adjustable disc made for microdosing. By rotating the disc, you can reduce the chamber size so that the herbs in there will be packed tighter and vaped more evenly.
Smarter charging
The AirVape Pro Legacy is equipped with a removable 18650 type battery with a 3200 mAh capacity that can be charged in two ways; either with the included fast-charging USB-C cable or via wireless charging. Of course, the quickest way is still swapping it with another charged battery!
Depending on how long you like to have your sessions you can choose to set the session timer to 3, 5 or 10 minutes. It also has a built-in motion detector which it uses to shut it off after 60 seconds if no movement is detected. The combination of a session timer and motion detection means your herbs will be preserved better and the battery won’t drain, no matter if you forget to shut it off when you keep it in your pocket or place it on a table.
Ready for concentrate
As the AirVape Legacy Pro now uses both convection and conduction heating it’s even better than before to vaporize concentrate. Simply place the included concentrate pad in the chamber before adding your concentrate on top of it and you are ready to start. Temperatures above 215°C are recommended for vaping concentrates such as wax and oil.
Easier to keep clean
Everyone knows that the key to consistent flavourful vapour is to keep the vape clean and AirVape has made this easy with the Legacy Pro. It doesn’t have any tiny parts and you can easily remove the screen, mouthpiece and air path of glass when it’s time to clean or replace them. The heating chamber now also has a funnel around it to make sure the herbs go into it when you’re filling it.
How to use the AirVape Legacy Pro
Pack the chamber lightly with herbs (or if use wax, add it on the concentrate pad first).
Press the power button three times.
Adjust the temperature with the Up and Down-buttons. After it vibrates it’s ready to start producing vapour.
Inhale the tasty vapour through the mouthpiece.
Warranty
The AirVape Legacy Pro comes with a 2-year warranty by MagicVaporizers and an additional limited lifetime warranty through the manufacturer.

Who is the AirVape Legacy Pro for?
Looking for a vaporizer that does it all? You might just have found it in the AirVape Legacy Pro. Its capability of delivering world-class hybrid heating, ultra-fast heat-up time, wireless charging and concentrate mode is guaranteed to impress even the most experienced vape enthusiast.
The team behind AirVape took a long look at the feedback received from the users of the original Legacy and meticulously improved a long list of things, including the heating technology, airflow and chamber size. With these improvements and some new features, the Legacy Pro is ready to battle for the first place of portable vaporizers.
Even better looking
The Legacy was already a great-looking vape, but the Legacy Pro is even more stylish and slightly lighter. The shape is similar, but the edges have been curved for a more sophisticated look and the matte black finish now features a gold accent on the front, representing the AirVape logo.
Not only does the Legacy Pro have a premium look, but thanks to the combination of black textile and leather, they have also considered the environmental aspects as the textile is hemp-based and the leather is vegan.
New heating technology
With the AirVape Legacy Pro, you get the best of both worlds as it utilises both convection and conduction heating. The convection heat is still the same as in the original Legacy, but they have also added conduction heat by applying direct heating at the gold-plated heating chamber. This means more efficient herb extraction and faster heating.
It takes less than 15 seconds to reach vapour temperatures which will be indicated by a vibration. You can set the temperature with a 1-degree precision from 93°C to 227°C so you can always find the perfect temperature matching whatever you’re in the mood to vaporize.
“On-demand” mode
When the “On-Demand” mode is switched on, the chamber is being heated only when the power button is pushed, and the temperature drops as soon as the button is released. This way the active ingredients are only being extracted when you are activating the heating and thus preventing the herbs from being wasted.
This mode is also helpful for users that prefer a higher temperature setting, but with a shorter period of heat. While in “On-Demand” mode, you have full control over how many seconds you allow the herbs to be actively heated.
Improved airflow
The most common complaint of the original Legacy was about the airflow, so it’s no surprise that has been the biggest priority for AirVape to improve upon. After thorough testing, we can confirm that the airflow resistance of the Legacy Pro is now minimal and the new closing mechanism helps to better isolate the air path.
20% bigger chamber
With a higher heat efficiency and better airflow, AirVape also took the opportunity to increase the chamber size of the Legacy Pro by 20%. This means you can now have longer sessions by yourself, or more easily share when your friends inevitably want to give this premium vape a try.
Great for microdosing
If you enjoy microdosing or simply just prefer using smaller quantities of herb then you will appreciate the Legacy Pro’s built-in and adjustable disc made for microdosing. By rotating the disc, you can reduce the chamber size so that the herbs in there will be packed tighter and vaped more evenly.
Smarter charging
The AirVape Pro Legacy is equipped with a removable 18650 type battery with a 3200 mAh capacity that can be charged in two ways; either with the included fast-charging USB-C cable or via wireless charging. Of course, the quickest way is still swapping it with another charged battery!
Depending on how long you like to have your sessions you can choose to set the session timer to 3, 5 or 10 minutes. It also has a built-in motion detector which it uses to shut it off after 60 seconds if no movement is detected. The combination of a session timer and motion detection means your herbs will be preserved better and the battery won’t drain, no matter if you forget to shut it off when you keep it in your pocket or place it on a table.
Ready for concentrate
As the AirVape Legacy Pro now uses both convection and conduction heating it’s even better than before to vaporize concentrate. Simply place the included concentrate pad in the chamber before adding your concentrate on top of it and you are ready to start. Temperatures above 215°C are recommended for vaping concentrates such as wax and oil.
Easier to keep clean
Everyone knows that the key to consistent flavourful vapour is to keep the vape clean and AirVape has made this easy with the Legacy Pro. It doesn’t have any tiny parts and you can easily remove the screen, mouthpiece and air path of glass when it’s time to clean or replace them. The heating chamber now also has a funnel around it to make sure the herbs go into it when you’re filling it.
How to use the AirVape Legacy Pro
Pack the chamber lightly with herbs (or if use wax, add it on the concentrate pad first).
Press the power button three times.
Adjust the temperature with the Up and Down-buttons. After it vibrates it’s ready to start producing vapour.
Inhale the tasty vapour through the mouthpiece.
Warranty
The AirVape Legacy Pro comes with a 2-year warranty by MagicVaporizers and an additional limited lifetime warranty through the manufacturer.

Who is the Arizer Air Max for?
The Arizer Air Max is the perfect vape for those who want a slower-paced, more flavourful experience with their herbs. Even though it's capable of generating thick vapour at higher temperatures, the main strength of the Air Max is its ability to maximise herb extraction and produce tasty vapour throughout the whole session.
Thanks to the powerful battery, the ceramic heater and the included water pipe adapter it’s easy to experiment with water tools which is a big plus, but if you enjoy vaping concentrates such as oil and wax the Air Max isn’t ideal as it only supports herb vaporization. Overall, it’s a great portable vape for those who value taste and convenience over thick clouds.
Improved heating element
The new Arizer Air Max is built with an advanced, rapid-heating ceramic heater that’s stronger and faster than its predecessor. This updated heating system can keep up even when you're using the vape with water tools and can reach vaping temperatures in under a minute.
To maximise herb extraction it utilizes hybrid heating, which is the simultaneous use of conduction and convection heat. Conduction heats your herb via direct contact while convection heats it by circulating the air in and around the material.
Full temperature control
Find the perfect temperature for maximum flavour or adjust it mid-session to extract the maximum from your herbs. The Arizer Air Max has a precise 1-degree temperature control with an impressive range from 50°C to 220°C. If you’re looking for flavour, try 180 to 200°C and if you want stronger effects go for 200°C to 220°C.
Signature glass tubes
The Arizer signature glass tubes are great for keeping vapour pure and flavourful – but one of its best qualities is that it makes loading the oven so uncomplicated. Instead of scooping herbs directly into the chamber, simply twist the tube into your herbs to pick them up! This also means clean-up becomes much easier when necessary. Simply soak the tubes in isopropyl alcohol for an hour or two, then rinse them off in hot water until they're clean and ready to go for the next session.
Less restrictive airflow
While other portable vapes from Arizer have been criticised for being too hard to draw vapour from it’s easy to notice the big improvements made to the airflow on Arizer Air Max. The improved heating element can easily keep up with a faster draw and you can now comfortably enjoy the tasty vapour it produces.
If you enjoy fast draws, we recommend you purchase a long glass tube as the vapour doesn’t have enough distance to cool down when passing through the included, short glass tubes at the highest temperatures.
More customisability
The Air Max settings give you full control to customise your sessions. You can adjust the audible alerts or turn the volume off, how long it takes to hold the button to power it on, the screen brightness, switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius and change the session timer in 1 minute-increments between 5 and 15 minutes.
There are also two modes you can have separate settings for; Normal Mode and Dark Mode. When Dark Mode is activated, the display will show small low-lit symbols to indicate the status of the device. Perfect for the discreet night-time sessions!
Bigger and stronger battery
With the Air Max, you'll never be without power for those long sessions. This high-capacity rechargeable, removable and replaceable 26650 battery provides up to 2 hours of use per charge which is 40 minutes more than the Arizer Air 2. It also features fast USB-C charging (up to 90% charge in just two hours!). If you forget to charge the battery you don’t have to worry either, as the Air Max can be used while charging.
Ready for water tools
If you want even smoother vapour, it’s easy with the Air Max as it comes with a frosted glass water pipe adapter that allows you to use your favourite glass bubblers with no hassle. The 14 mm joint size fits most water tools and the auto-inversion screen makes reading easy, regardless if it’s upside down or not!
Warranty
The electronics of the Arizer Air Max are covered by a 3-year warranty, while the ceramic heating element comes with a lifetime warranty.

Who is the Arizer Air Max for?
The Arizer Air Max is the perfect vape for those who want a slower-paced, more flavourful experience with their herbs. Even though it's capable of generating thick vapour at higher temperatures, the main strength of the Air Max is its ability to maximise herb extraction and produce tasty vapour throughout the whole session.
Thanks to the powerful battery, the ceramic heater and the included water pipe adapter it’s easy to experiment with water tools which is a big plus, but if you enjoy vaping concentrates such as oil and wax the Air Max isn’t ideal as it only supports herb vaporization. Overall, it’s a great portable vape for those who value taste and convenience over thick clouds.
Improved heating element
The new Arizer Air Max is built with an advanced, rapid-heating ceramic heater that’s stronger and faster than its predecessor. This updated heating system can keep up even when you're using the vape with water tools and can reach vaping temperatures in under a minute.
To maximise herb extraction it utilizes hybrid heating, which is the simultaneous use of conduction and convection heat. Conduction heats your herb via direct contact while convection heats it by circulating the air in and around the material.
Full temperature control
Find the perfect temperature for maximum flavour or adjust it mid-session to extract the maximum from your herbs. The Arizer Air Max has a precise 1-degree temperature control with an impressive range from 50°C to 220°C. If you’re looking for flavour, try 180 to 200°C and if you want stronger effects go for 200°C to 220°C.
Signature glass tubes
The Arizer signature glass tubes are great for keeping vapour pure and flavourful – but one of its best qualities is that it makes loading the oven so uncomplicated. Instead of scooping herbs directly into the chamber, simply twist the tube into your herbs to pick them up! This also means clean-up becomes much easier when necessary. Simply soak the tubes in isopropyl alcohol for an hour or two, then rinse them off in hot water until they're clean and ready to go for the next session.
Less restrictive airflow
While other portable vapes from Arizer have been criticised for being too hard to draw vapour from it’s easy to notice the big improvements made to the airflow on Arizer Air Max. The improved heating element can easily keep up with a faster draw and you can now comfortably enjoy the tasty vapour it produces.
If you enjoy fast draws, we recommend you purchase a long glass tube as the vapour doesn’t have enough distance to cool down when passing through the included, short glass tubes at the highest temperatures.
More customisability
The Air Max settings give you full control to customise your sessions. You can adjust the audible alerts or turn the volume off, how long it takes to hold the button to power it on, the screen brightness, switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius and change the session timer in 1 minute-increments between 5 and 15 minutes.
There are also two modes you can have separate settings for; Normal Mode and Dark Mode. When Dark Mode is activated, the display will show small low-lit symbols to indicate the status of the device. Perfect for the discreet night-time sessions!
Bigger and stronger battery
With the Air Max, you'll never be without power for those long sessions. This high-capacity rechargeable, removable and replaceable 26650 battery provides up to 2 hours of use per charge which is 40 minutes more than the Arizer Air 2. It also features fast USB-C charging (up to 90% charge in just two hours!). If you forget to charge the battery you don’t have to worry either, as the Air Max can be used while charging.
Ready for water tools
If you want even smoother vapour, it’s easy with the Air Max as it comes with a frosted glass water pipe adapter that allows you to use your favourite glass bubblers with no hassle. The 14 mm joint size fits most water tools and the auto-inversion screen makes reading easy, regardless if it’s upside down or not!
Warranty
The electronics of the Arizer Air Max are covered by a 3-year warranty, while the ceramic heating element comes with a lifetime warranty.

About Us at MagicVaporizers
The idea that is now MagicVaporizers originated on a skiing holiday in northern Sweden in 2012, when I (Peter) and Sam were introduced to a revolutionary way of consuming herbs by an American at an after-ski party - vaporizing. Soon thereafter we realized that this was the future and that once people experienced what we did they would be just as enthusiastic as us.
After establishing the company and thoroughly testing hundreds of vapes we felt confident we were ready to start offering what we believed were the best vaporizers for the lowest prices in mid-2013 with our original Swedish shop - vaporizers.se.
The shop was an instant success, and we literally sold out our initial stock before we could receive our second order from the manufacturers. To our surprise not only did we get orders from Sweden, but also from our neighbouring countries which lead us to believe that we needed to think bigger than just Sweden.
In the fall of 2013, and after a lot of “product testing”, we came up with the brand that is now established as the largest seller of vaporizers throughout Europe - MagicVaporizers. Initially, we launched our shops in seven more countries; the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Finland, and Denmark.
The interest in vapes, as well as the addition of more quality vape brands, really took off starting in 2014 and our bet on adding more countries became a huge success. Since then, we have added 14 more European countries with localized shops and are always focusing on growing our brand to get more people to experience the magic of vaporization.
In late 2020 we decided to expand our presence in the United Kingdom and established another warehouse in Portsmouth. Now customers in UK can enjoy fast shipments with next-day delivery from DPD and not have to worry about any custom duties or long delivery times.
Even though we have grown to where we are now, we still keep to our core values of serving customers with quality vapes for low prices and being available to answer any questions from customers who need help before and after purchase.
How do we keep our prices so low?
We buy direct from manufacturers and we bargain hard to get the best price, and then pass the savings on to you.
We buy in large volumes and contract early to get the best prices.
We keep our costs low—because every cent we save is a cent you save.
It's not complicated. We just focus on what matters - great vapes + good prices = value.

What proof do I present when requesting a price match?
Simply provide MagicVaporizers support with the competitor's website address, showing the price of the product and any terms and conditions. We will then check the website to verify the lower price and availability of the product.
Once your price match request is verified, we will create a discount code for you to purchase the product from us at the lower price.

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)
£89
£119
Features
Induction heating
Great at heating DynaVap vaporizers
Full temperature control (120°C to 425°C)
Borosilicate glass cups
Removable batteries (2 × 2900 mAh)
Safety features
The Wand by Ispire is a portable induction heater for use with concentrates, and in addition to that, it’s also great at heating the tips of DynaVap vaporizers.
What is induction heat?
Induction heat is a highly accurate, controllable, and more predictable heat source than the torches used normally used for this kind of vaping, so you’re going to experience consistency and less waste by eliminating over- or under-heating. Select any temperature you want in 5-degree increments, from 120°C to 425°C.
Wand Glass Adapter for DynaVap vaporizers
If you plan on using the Wand with a DynaVap vaporizer, we recommend getting the Wand Glass Adapter so you can lodge the tip instead of having to swirl it around for even heat. With it, you no longer need to keep an eye on it and can use it hands-free. Just sit back and wait for the “click” of the Captive Cap.
Automatic and manual mode
You can use it in one of two modes, either manual mode or automatic mode. To use it in manual mode, hold the large button down until the cup or your DynaVap reaches your set temperature.
When you first hold the button down the Wand will blink with a red light, then once you put over something metal it will engage the induction heating and pulse a white light while it’s heating up. When it arrives at your set temperature the white light will stay on, meaning you can go ahead and enjoy whatever you're heating.
To use it in automatic mode, double press the large button, and then place it on the induction cup or put your DynaVap in it. One great thing about the automatic mode is that you can take it off and on throughout the cycle and it will just re-engage the heating, so you can sort of feather the heat while in use.
Removable batteries
The Wand is powered by two replaceable 2900 mAh batteries that can be charged with the included USB-C cable, or externally if you have a charger for 18650 batteries.

Duality Torch
£29
£38
The Duality is a high-quality butane torch lighter. It has a pocket-proof ignition and a single or double flame to choose from depending on your preference. It also features a large tank window that allows you to keep an eye on the fuel level, as well as making it easy to refill it without issue. The flame can be adjusted with the dial at the bottom and the flint ignition can be replaced if it gets worn out.
It ships empty so you need to add butane gas to it before you can use it.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Intended for use with: DynaVap B, DynaVap M, DynaVap M+ (Plus), DynaVap Omni and DynaVap VonG (i): Titanium.

Cyclone Triple Torch
£11
£15
The Vertigo Cyclone Triple Torch is one of the most budget friendly torch lighters you will ever find. It features a large, clear fuel tank so you’ll always know how much fuel remains and it also makes refilling it a lot easier. The wind resistant flame is capable of lighting at 3'500 meters above sea level.
Fill it with filtered butane gas, available at hobby stores and Amazon, before use (not included). We recommend using the brand Colibri but any butane gas that has been filtered at least five times should work well.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Do not clean the Cyclone Triple Torch with alcohol as this will degrade the plastic, resulting in fuel leaks.

DynaVap M Features
Made of stainless steel
Perfect for micro-dosing
On-demand vapour
Unique “clicking” cap
Hybrid heating
Designed and manufactured in USA
Who is the DynaVap M for?
The VapCap M by DynaVap is perfect for anyone looking for an easy-to-use, manually controlled vape with a practically indestructible build. The simple design produces tasty, reliable vapour and allows for stealthy vape sessions where other vaporizers would draw too much attention.
The new things on this version are the revamped chiral airport, an “M’ shaped air intake for easy rocking and adjustments, and updated geometrical indentations on both the tip and body for a slick, stylish finish.
What’s new with the “M” edition?
To ensure maximum flavour, the DynaVap M is still constructed from medical grade stainless steel but it now features the new “Captive Cap” with two small indentations near the end to keep the cap securely in place without affecting the airflow.
Another great feature is that you can adjust the bowl size to half the size for easier micro-dosing. If you are a fan of cooling the vapour you will also appreciate the improved tapered mouthpiece which lets you connect it to a water tool quick and easy.
Manually controlled
The DynaVap M can be heated by practically any external heat source, such as a blowtorch or induction heater. Thanks to this ingenious design it can deliver powerful and tasty hits from tiny amounts of herbs, instantly. The ‘cap’ makes an audible click when it has have reached the minimum temperature and is ready to start the vapour production.
With the DynaVap M’s manual heating, you’re in complete control of the vapour density. Create fast and light vapour, or a thick and heavy vapour, depending on where you heat the cap. Even with the small bowl size, every hit is full of potency and flavour.
Custom bowl size
If you like to match your herb consumption with the occasion you will appreciate that the DynaVap M bowl has two settings - 0.1 grams and 0.05 grams. Perfect for micro-dosing! The stainless-steel bowl is surprisingly effective, even with small amounts of herbs loaded. It's also quick to reload, so you can vape the next bowl quickly after finishing the last one.
It’s capable of vaporizing the entire bowl in 1 to 2 hits but if you don’t finish you can even return to the same bowl later since the DynaVap M does not heat your herb between inhales.
Convenient to bring everywhere
The DynaVap M is 9 centimetres long and weighs only 19 grams, which makes it one of the smallest vape on the market. It’s not just the perfect vaporizer for festivals and camping, it’s also ideal for any traveller as the and the only other things you need are a lighter and some herbs. No other portable dry herb vaporizer offers such instant and powerful vapour at such a reasonable price.
How to use it?
Load the DynaVap M by either adding your herbs to the top or press the tip in the herbs a few times to load it. Use your finger to dust off any excess herbs and put the cap on.
Once your bowl is filled, heat the cap with either a torch or an induction heater until you hear the famous DynaVap “click” that lets you know it’s ready to be used. You can control the airflow by covering the air intake while hitting for thicker vapour, or leave it uncovered for lighter and smoother hits.
Warranty
All DynaVap M vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DynaVap products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is the Boundless CFX for?
If you’re desiring a portable, simple-to-use vaporizer than gets the job done with no fuss, the Boundless CFX is the perfect option. Providing everything a decent vape should, this compact device packs some serious power without being bulky or complex to operate. Easy to carry around and boasting a hugely impressive battery life, the Boundless CFX has multiple selling points.
Easy to Use
Requiring virtually no previous experience to successfully operate, the Boundless CFX is perhaps one of the simplest & convenient vapes on the market. Able to function perfectly well with small or large loads, no specific loading technique is required to make this device work. The capacity of its impressively large high-grade ceramic chamber allows you to have longer sessions with no issues, yet is easily versatile enough to operate just as efficiently with lighter loads.
Isolated Air Path
Guaranteed to keep all vapour produced away from its inner electronics, the taste and quality of the vapour created is sure to impress. Better still, the isolated air path means there are zero restrictions in terms of air flow. This makes the entire inhalation process seamless and easy – ideal for beginners.
Impressive Heating Time & Battery Life
Boasting 80W of power, the Boundless CFX can fully heat up in just 20 seconds! Allowing you to get your experience started pretty much immediately, both planned and spontaneous vaping sessions are easily achievable here. You can achieve up to 15 5-minute sessions from a fully-charged battery.
Portable
Able to be thrown into a bag or large pocket when on-the-go, you certainly won’t be confined to a desktop when using the Boundless CFX. Resembling a simple cell phone in appearance for a truly discreet nature, this device measures-in at 7 × 3,2 × 13 cm and has a distinctive lightweight feel. It also boasts a useful silicone coating to ensure it doesn’t slip out of your hand or feel too hot during a session.
Versatile with Total Temperature Control
Able to vaporize both dry herbs and concentrates with ease, the Boundless CFX comes with a separate capsule specifically designed for concentrates. Allowing you to truly tailor the nature of your vaping to suit your exact requirements, you also have full power over this vape’s temperature too. Offering heats varying from 38°C to 221°C, fans of both hot and cooler temperatures will be satisfied.

Who is the Boundless CFX for?
If you’re desiring a portable, simple-to-use vaporizer than gets the job done with no fuss, the Boundless CFX is the perfect option. Providing everything a decent vape should, this compact device packs some serious power without being bulky or complex to operate. Easy to carry around and boasting a hugely impressive battery life, the Boundless CFX has multiple selling points.
Easy to Use
Requiring virtually no previous experience to successfully operate, the Boundless CFX is perhaps one of the simplest & convenient vapes on the market. Able to function perfectly well with small or large loads, no specific loading technique is required to make this device work. The capacity of its impressively large high-grade ceramic chamber allows you to have longer sessions with no issues, yet is easily versatile enough to operate just as efficiently with lighter loads.
Isolated Air Path
Guaranteed to keep all vapour produced away from its inner electronics, the taste and quality of the vapour created is sure to impress. Better still, the isolated air path means there are zero restrictions in terms of air flow. This makes the entire inhalation process seamless and easy – ideal for beginners.
Impressive Heating Time & Battery Life
Boasting 80W of power, the Boundless CFX can fully heat up in just 20 seconds! Allowing you to get your experience started pretty much immediately, both planned and spontaneous vaping sessions are easily achievable here. You can achieve up to 15 5-minute sessions from a fully-charged battery.
Portable
Able to be thrown into a bag or large pocket when on-the-go, you certainly won’t be confined to a desktop when using the Boundless CFX. Resembling a simple cell phone in appearance for a truly discreet nature, this device measures-in at 7 × 3,2 × 13 cm and has a distinctive lightweight feel. It also boasts a useful silicone coating to ensure it doesn’t slip out of your hand or feel too hot during a session.
Versatile with Total Temperature Control
Able to vaporize both dry herbs and concentrates with ease, the Boundless CFX comes with a separate capsule specifically designed for concentrates. Allowing you to truly tailor the nature of your vaping to suit your exact requirements, you also have full power over this vape’s temperature too. Offering heats varying from 38°C to 221°C, fans of both hot and cooler temperatures will be satisfied.
Warranty
All Boundless CFX vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Boundless Vapes Technology, are completely authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty.

Who is the Boundless Tera for?
If you’re looking for a solidly reliable vaporizer you can truly count on for years to come, the Boundless Tera is a great option. It’s portable and easy to fit in the palm of your hand, provides impressive power via convection heat and produces great tasting vapour every time. The size of the Boundless Tera is slightly larger than the smallest category of portable vapes, but the size has been put to good use as it’s only rivalled by the even bigger Mighty vaporizer when it comes to power.
Full Convection System for Great Taste
Utilizing an entire convection heating system throughout its function, the Boundless Tera guarantees pure, tasty vapour every single time it’s used. Featuring perfectly even heat distribution as well as a fully isolated heating path to keep all vapour separate from metallic electronics, a purer unspoiled flavour is produced. To achieve maximum results from this convection method, it’s recommended to take longer, slower draws to generate the best possible vapour clouds.
Two Swappable Batteries
Complete with not just one but two swappable 18650 2200 mAh batteries, you can effortlessly keep your sessions going for longer. With each fully-charged battery able to provide up to 60 minutes of continuous vaping time, simply swap-out your used battery for a new one if you require a longer session. The batteries can be charged either through the unit via USB or via a wall charger (not included).
Portable & Solid
The Boundless Tera is easily able to fit into virtually any bag with ease and it only weighs around 300 grams. Thanks to its robust design, you’ll never have to worry about your vaporizer becoming damaged during long journeys. Its measurements come to 4.0 × 5.5 × 11.0 cm, meaning this vape may be slightly too large to fit into a trouser or jacket pocket, but that it’s still very comfortable to hold in the palm of your hand.
Fast Heating Time & Simple Temperature Control
Dependent on your chosen temperature, the Boundless Tera fully heats in just 20 – 30 seconds. Allowing you to begin an entire session at a moment’s notice or simply enjoy a single hit when out and about, the speed of this vape’s heat-up time is hugely beneficial. Better still, you have full control over the temperature, allowing you to select from an impressive range between 60°C and 220°C. It’s digital LED display demonstrates current temperature readings & battery level at all times during use too, meaning you’ll always be in-the-know at how your vaporizer is functioning.
Not only for herbs
But the Tera doesn't stop at dry herb—you can also use it to vape wax or oil at 260°C with the concentrate mode. Similarly to loading in dry herb, all you need to do is dab wax or drip oil onto the provided pad before activating the concentrate mode by pressing the power button 3 times.
If that's not enough customisation for you, Boundless also made sure you had 3 different magnetic mouthpieces to choose from. The plastic mouthpiece is ideal for convenience, swivelling into a folded position as needed. If clean, smooth vapour is most important to you, the glass mouthpiece is the ideal cooling air path.
Included Water Pipe Adapter
Guaranteed to increase the versatility of your vaping sessions, the Boundless Tera comes with a handy WPA. Allowing you to easy use it with virtually any 1, 1.4 or 1.8 cm glass connection, this vaporizer is conveniently compatible with a huge range of different-sized glassware items.
Warranty
All Boundless Tera vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Boundless Vapes Technology, are completely authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty.

Make charging easier and extend the longevity of your vaporizer by using this Magnetic USB-C Adapter.

Who is the Boundless CFX+ for?
After the big success with the original Boundless CFX it’s no surprise that Boundless decided to continue developing it, and this has resulted in the long-awaited Boundless CFX+.
The Boundless CFX+ is for those who value effortless vaping and portability over customisability. It might not have all the features of other brands, but it excels at what’s most important – producing high quality vapour. If you’re exclusively vaping herbs and want a reliable vape you can bring with you everywhere the CFX+ is an excellent choice.
Maximising flavour
Like all other vapes from Boundless, you will enjoy how quickly and thoroughly the CFX+ turns your herbs into flavourful and dense vapour. The ceramic heating chamber utilizes conduction heating and takes around 30 seconds to reach vaping temperatures.
New for the CFX+ is also the cooling air path made of Zirconia. The spiralling design of the air path ensures that the vapour is cooler and therefore more comfortable to inhale than before.
New shape
With its smaller and more durable design, the Boundless CFX+ is perfect for bringing with you when you’re leaving home. It also has a silicone coating that will keep your device safe from drops or scratches!
Even though the unit itself is smaller, the chamber of the CFX+ is still very large for being a portable vaporizer and can easily fit 0.5 grams of loosely packed herbs.
Large colour display
The thing that makes the Boundless CFX+ stand out compared to other vapes is the large colour display that lets you know all the important information in a beautiful interface. Use the buttons on the side of the unit to select the settings you prefer and then select “Start” to initiate the heating process. Doesn’t get any simpler than that!
Once you’ve started the session the vibrant display will show the selected temperature, the current temperature and how long is left on the current session before the heating is automatically turned off.
Find the perfect temperature
With the Boundless CFX+, you have two options to select the temperatures; pre-set mode or precision mode. In the pre-set mode you select between four temperatures – 171, 188, 204 or 221°C - while in precision mode you can choose any temperature you want from 121 to 221°C.
Customisability
The Boundless CFX+ allows you to customise your sessions by setting the session timer (2, 4, 6, or 8 minutes) to ensure you always have time to finish longer sessions without having to worry about the battery getting drained.
You can also choose between low or high brightness which means it’s comfortable to look at the display both in dark rooms and outside in bright sunlight.
If you want to change any of the settings all you have to do is press the up and down buttons after the unit has been turned on.
Magnetic mouthpiece
The Boundless CFX+ comes with an upgraded magnetic mouthpiece that not only allows for easier cleaning but it also makes filling the chamber with herbs easier and quicker.
Built-in stirring tool
The built-in stirring tool is located underneath the mouthpiece and it can be used to stir your herbs during a session and help with emptying out once you're done.
How to use the Boundless CFX+
Remove the magnetic mouthpiece to reveal the chamber.
Fill the chamber lightly with herbs.
Reattach the mouthpiece.
Start the unit by pressing the up and down buttons and wait for it to vibrate (3 seconds).
The Boundless CFX+ will now begin heating to the latest temperature setting. You can also change the desired temperature by pushing the up or down button.
Wait for it to reach the selected temperature wait for the vibration (around 30 seconds). Tip: wait a little longer after the vibration if you want even more dense vapour.
The tasty vapour is now ready to be inhaled through the mouthpiece. Enjoy!
Now with USB-C charging
Perhaps the biggest upgrade compared to the original Boundless CFX is the USB-C charging port. You can now charge the two built-in 2500 mAh batteries in under an hour which means less charging and more vaping!
Easy to clean
The Boundless CFX+ is one of the easiest vapes to keep clean. The only regular cleaning you have to do is use the included cleaning tool and stirring tool to remove the herbs from the chamber once your session is done.
To do a deeper clean, use isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs on everything except the silicone mouthpiece screen holder which should only be cleaned by rinsing it through warm water.
Warranty
All Boundless CFX+ vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Boundless, are completely authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty.

Who is the Boundless CFX+ for?
After the big success with the original Boundless CFX it’s no surprise that Boundless decided to continue developing it, and this has resulted in the long-awaited Boundless CFX+.
The Boundless CFX+ is for those who value effortless vaping and portability over customisability. It might not have all the features of other brands, but it excels at what’s most important – producing high quality vapour. If you’re exclusively vaping herbs and want a reliable vape you can bring with you everywhere the CFX+ is an excellent choice.
Maximising flavour
Like all other vapes from Boundless, you will enjoy how quickly and thoroughly the CFX+ turns your herbs into flavourful and dense vapour. The ceramic heating chamber utilizes conduction heating and takes around 30 seconds to reach vaping temperatures.
New for the CFX+ is also the cooling air path made of Zirconia. The spiralling design of the air path ensures that the vapour is cooler and therefore more comfortable to inhale than before.
New shape
With its smaller and more durable design, the Boundless CFX+ is perfect for bringing with you when you’re leaving home. It also has a silicone coating that will keep your device safe from drops or scratches!
Even though the unit itself is smaller, the chamber of the CFX+ is still very large for being a portable vaporizer and can easily fit 0.5 grams of loosely packed herbs.
Large colour display
The thing that makes the Boundless CFX+ stand out compared to other vapes is the large colour display that lets you know all the important information in a beautiful interface. Use the buttons on the side of the unit to select the settings you prefer and then select “Start” to initiate the heating process. Doesn’t get any simpler than that!
Once you’ve started the session the vibrant display will show the selected temperature, the current temperature and how long is left on the current session before the heating is automatically turned off.
Find the perfect temperature
With the Boundless CFX+, you have two options to select the temperatures; pre-set mode or precision mode. In the pre-set mode you select between four temperatures – 171, 188, 204 or 221°C - while in precision mode you can choose any temperature you want from 121 to 221°C.
Customisability
The Boundless CFX+ allows you to customise your sessions by setting the session timer (2, 4, 6, or 8 minutes) to ensure you always have time to finish longer sessions without having to worry about the battery getting drained.
You can also choose between low or high brightness which means it’s comfortable to look at the display both in dark rooms and outside in bright sunlight.
If you want to change any of the settings all you have to do is press the up and down buttons after the unit has been turned on.
Magnetic mouthpiece
The Boundless CFX+ comes with an upgraded magnetic mouthpiece that not only allows for easier cleaning but it also makes filling the chamber with herbs easier and quicker.
Built-in stirring tool
The built-in stirring tool is located underneath the mouthpiece and it can be used to stir your herbs during a session and help with emptying out once you're done.
How to use the Boundless CFX+
Remove the magnetic mouthpiece to reveal the chamber.
Fill the chamber lightly with herbs.
Reattach the mouthpiece.
Start the unit by pressing the up and down buttons and wait for it to vibrate (3 seconds).
The Boundless CFX+ will now begin heating to the latest temperature setting. You can also change the desired temperature by pushing the up or down button.
Wait for it to reach the selected temperature wait for the vibration (around 30 seconds). Tip: wait a little longer after the vibration if you want even more dense vapour.
The tasty vapour is now ready to be inhaled through the mouthpiece. Enjoy!
Now with USB-C charging
Perhaps the biggest upgrade compared to the original Boundless CFX is the USB-C charging port. You can now charge the two built-in 2500 mAh batteries in under an hour which means less charging and more vaping!
Easy to clean
The Boundless CFX+ is one of the easiest vapes to keep clean. The only regular cleaning you have to do is use the included cleaning tool and stirring tool to remove the herbs from the chamber once your session is done.
To do a deeper clean, use isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs on everything except the silicone mouthpiece screen holder which should only be cleaned by rinsing it through warm water.
Warranty
All Boundless CFX+ vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Boundless, are completely authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty.

Who is the DaVinci IQC for?
The DaVinci IQC is for those who want to be in full control of their vaping sessions. There are many features that make it perfect for experimenting and experience different vapour flavours, like its zirconia flavour chamber, different heating modes and large temperature range. The precision mode also makes it easy to explore all available temperatures (0 to 221°C) without any hassle!
Sealed vapour path of Zirconia/glass
DaVinci's most recent innovation is a vapour path that has been sealed with zirconia and glass. This means no metals or plastics will come in contact with your vapour which ensures that you will only experience pure and tasteful sessions with the IQC!
Exceptional flavour
DaVinci's oven is like no other. The DaVinci IQC’s glass-lined ceramic oven boasts a temperature control system with a 1-degree accuracy and offers precision mode for the ultimate degree control as well as a “Smart Path” mode which provides an easy-to-use yet practical way of experimenting with pre-set temperature increases.
Powerful and removable battery
The DaVinci IQC comes with a 18650, 3000 mAh rechargeable battery that is able to provide up to 2 hours of run time. This makes it a perfect companion for those outdoor days or long trips without access to power outlets.
The battery is replaceable too, so if you are going to be out for a while, carry some extras—you never know when they will come in handy!
You can use the up and down buttons to see how much battery power your vaporizer has left. It will also vibrate when there is only 10% of the battery remaining.
Can connect to water tools
The IQC comes with a water pipe adapter that can be hooked up to any 10 mm water pipe for an even smoother and cleaner vapour experience. Letting the vapour pass through a water tool allows it to cool down and easier to consume.
3 modes to control the temperature
“Smart Path”
With the “Smart Path” mode on your DaVinci IQC, you can use four different settings that will gradually increase the temperature in the ceramic oven. The first setting is called "Flavour" and it starts at 176°C before finishing at 188°C after 8 minutes.
There are three other modes: Mind, Body and Rest which start at different temperatures and finish 8 minutes later with a 12°C higher temperature.
Precision
This mode allows you to be in control of the temperature down to a single degree. To enter precision mode, click on the power button once which will show the current temperature and then adjust it with up and down arrows to pick your preferred temperature.
Boost
Pressing the red power button during your session will allow you to boost the temperature up to 210°C. Hold it for as long as you desire and press on either of the arrows when done so that your IQC vaporizer returns from the Boost mode to the temperature set beforehand.
Charging by USB-C
Charge your IQC vaporizer in as little as 2 hours with USB-C charging. Plus, if you're on the go and need to quickly charge your phone then its reverse charging capability is perfect for just that occasion!
App to extend customisability
DaVinci's latest innovation is a web-based app for both iOS and Android OS which enables control of the IQC not only from smartphones but also tablets and desktops.
Using the app you also can create custom “Smart Paths” to simplify your DaVinci IQC sessions by creating, naming and saving automatic temperature adjustments.
What’s the difference between DaVinci IQC and IQ2?
The IQ2 and the IQC are very similar vaporizers. The major differences are that IQC has USB-C charging, as well as a soft material mouthpiece with an accompanying flavour chamber lid and water pipe adapter. It is however lacking dose tracking and AirDial technology which the DaVinci IQ2 has.
Warranty
All DaVinci IQC vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DaVinci, are completely authentic and backed by a 5-year warranty on the device and a 1-year warranty on the battery.

Who is the DaVinci IQC for?
The DaVinci IQC is for those who want to be in full control of their vaping sessions. There are many features that make it perfect for experimenting and experience different vapour flavours, like its zirconia flavour chamber, different heating modes and large temperature range. The precision mode also makes it easy to explore all available temperatures (0 to 221°C) without any hassle!
Sealed vapour path of Zirconia/glass
DaVinci's most recent innovation is a vapour path that has been sealed with zirconia and glass. This means no metals or plastics will come in contact with your vapour which ensures that you will only experience pure and tasteful sessions with the IQC!
Exceptional flavour
DaVinci's oven is like no other. The DaVinci IQC’s glass-lined ceramic oven boasts a temperature control system with a 1-degree accuracy and offers precision mode for the ultimate degree control as well as a “Smart Path” mode which provides an easy-to-use yet practical way of experimenting with pre-set temperature increases.
Powerful and removable battery
The DaVinci IQC comes with a 18650, 3000 mAh rechargeable battery that is able to provide up to 2 hours of run time. This makes it a perfect companion for those outdoor days or long trips without access to power outlets.
The battery is replaceable too, so if you are going to be out for a while, carry some extras—you never know when they will come in handy!
You can use the up and down buttons to see how much battery power your vaporizer has left. It will also vibrate when there is only 10% of the battery remaining.
Can connect to water tools
The IQC comes with a water pipe adapter that can be hooked up to any 10 mm water pipe for an even smoother and cleaner vapour experience. Letting the vapour pass through a water tool allows it to cool down and easier to consume.
3 modes to control the temperature
“Smart Path”
With the “Smart Path” mode on your DaVinci IQC, you can use four different settings that will gradually increase the temperature in the ceramic oven. The first setting is called "Flavour" and it starts at 176°C before finishing at 188°C after 8 minutes.
There are three other modes: Mind, Body and Rest which start at different temperatures and finish 8 minutes later with a 12°C higher temperature.
Precision
This mode allows you to be in control of the temperature down to a single degree. To enter precision mode, click on the power button once which will show the current temperature and then adjust it with up and down arrows to pick your preferred temperature.
Boost
Pressing the red power button during your session will allow you to boost the temperature up to 210°C. Hold it for as long as you desire and press on either of the arrows when done so that your IQC vaporizer returns from the Boost mode to the temperature set beforehand.
Charging by USB-C
Charge your IQC vaporizer in as little as 2 hours with USB-C charging. Plus, if you're on the go and need to quickly charge your phone then its reverse charging capability is perfect for just that occasion!
App to extend customisability
DaVinci's latest innovation is a web-based app for both iOS and Android OS which enables control of the IQC not only from smartphones but also tablets and desktops.
Using the app you also can create custom “Smart Paths” to simplify your DaVinci IQC sessions by creating, naming and saving automatic temperature adjustments.
What’s the difference between DaVinci IQC and IQ2?
The IQ2 and the IQC are very similar vaporizers. The major differences are that IQC has USB-C charging, as well as a soft material mouthpiece with an accompanying flavour chamber lid and water pipe adapter. It is however lacking dose tracking and AirDial technology which the DaVinci IQ2 has.
Warranty
All DaVinci IQC vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DaVinci, are completely authentic and backed by a 5-year warranty on the device and a 1-year warranty on the battery.

Who is the DaVinci IQC for?
The DaVinci IQC is for those who want to be in full control of their vaping sessions. There are many features that make it perfect for experimenting and experience different vapour flavours, like its zirconia flavour chamber, different heating modes and large temperature range. The precision mode also makes it easy to explore all available temperatures (0 to 221°C) without any hassle!
Sealed vapour path of Zirconia/glass
DaVinci's most recent innovation is a vapour path that has been sealed with zirconia and glass. This means no metals or plastics will come in contact with your vapour which ensures that you will only experience pure and tasteful sessions with the IQC!
Exceptional flavour
DaVinci's oven is like no other. The DaVinci IQC’s glass-lined ceramic oven boasts a temperature control system with a 1-degree accuracy and offers precision mode for the ultimate degree control as well as a “Smart Path” mode which provides an easy-to-use yet practical way of experimenting with pre-set temperature increases.
Powerful and removable battery
The DaVinci IQC comes with a 18650, 3000 mAh rechargeable battery that is able to provide up to 2 hours of run time. This makes it a perfect companion for those outdoor days or long trips without access to power outlets.
The battery is replaceable too, so if you are going to be out for a while, carry some extras—you never know when they will come in handy!
You can use the up and down buttons to see how much battery power your vaporizer has left. It will also vibrate when there is only 10% of the battery remaining.
Can connect to water tools
The IQC comes with a water pipe adapter that can be hooked up to any 10 mm water pipe for an even smoother and cleaner vapour experience. Letting the vapour pass through a water tool allows it to cool down and easier to consume.
3 modes to control the temperature
“Smart Path”
With the “Smart Path” mode on your DaVinci IQC, you can use four different settings that will gradually increase the temperature in the ceramic oven. The first setting is called "Flavour" and it starts at 176°C before finishing at 188°C after 8 minutes.
There are three other modes: Mind, Body and Rest which start at different temperatures and finish 8 minutes later with a 12°C higher temperature.
Precision
This mode allows you to be in control of the temperature down to a single degree. To enter precision mode, click on the power button once which will show the current temperature and then adjust it with up and down arrows to pick your preferred temperature.
Boost
Pressing the red power button during your session will allow you to boost the temperature up to 210°C. Hold it for as long as you desire and press on either of the arrows when done so that your IQC vaporizer returns from the Boost mode to the temperature set beforehand.
Charging by USB-C
Charge your IQC vaporizer in as little as 2 hours with USB-C charging. Plus, if you're on the go and need to quickly charge your phone then its reverse charging capability is perfect for just that occasion!
App to extend customisability
DaVinci's latest innovation is a web-based app for both iOS and Android OS which enables control of the IQC not only from smartphones but also tablets and desktops.
Using the app you also can create custom “Smart Paths” to simplify your DaVinci IQC sessions by creating, naming and saving automatic temperature adjustments.
What’s the difference between DaVinci IQC and IQ2?
The IQ2 and the IQC are very similar vaporizers. The major differences are that IQC has USB-C charging, as well as a soft material mouthpiece with an accompanying flavour chamber lid and water pipe adapter. It is however lacking dose tracking and AirDial technology which the DaVinci IQ2 has.
Warranty
All DaVinci IQC vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DaVinci, are completely authentic and backed by a 5-year warranty on the device and a 1-year warranty on the battery.

Make charging easier and extend the longevity of your vaporizer by using this Magnetic USB-C Adapter.

Who is the DaVinci IQC for?
The DaVinci IQC is for those who want to be in full control of their vaping sessions. There are many features that make it perfect for experimenting and experience different vapour flavours, like its zirconia flavour chamber, different heating modes and large temperature range. The precision mode also makes it easy to explore all available temperatures (0 to 221°C) without any hassle!
Sealed vapour path of Zirconia/glass
DaVinci's most recent innovation is a vapour path that has been sealed with zirconia and glass. This means no metals or plastics will come in contact with your vapour which ensures that you will only experience pure and tasteful sessions with the IQC!
Exceptional flavour
DaVinci's oven is like no other. The DaVinci IQC’s glass-lined ceramic oven boasts a temperature control system with a 1-degree accuracy and offers precision mode for the ultimate degree control as well as a “Smart Path” mode which provides an easy-to-use yet practical way of experimenting with pre-set temperature increases.
Powerful and removable battery
The DaVinci IQC comes with a 18650, 3000 mAh rechargeable battery that is able to provide up to 2 hours of run time. This makes it a perfect companion for those outdoor days or long trips without access to power outlets.
The battery is replaceable too, so if you are going to be out for a while, carry some extras—you never know when they will come in handy!
You can use the up and down buttons to see how much battery power your vaporizer has left. It will also vibrate when there is only 10% of the battery remaining.
Can connect to water tools
The IQC comes with a water pipe adapter that can be hooked up to any 10 mm water pipe for an even smoother and cleaner vapour experience. Letting the vapour pass through a water tool allows it to cool down and easier to consume.
3 modes to control the temperature
“Smart Path”
With the “Smart Path” mode on your DaVinci IQC, you can use four different settings that will gradually increase the temperature in the ceramic oven. The first setting is called "Flavour" and it starts at 176°C before finishing at 188°C after 8 minutes.
There are three other modes: Mind, Body and Rest which start at different temperatures and finish 8 minutes later with a 12°C higher temperature.
Precision
This mode allows you to be in control of the temperature down to a single degree. To enter precision mode, click on the power button once which will show the current temperature and then adjust it with up and down arrows to pick your preferred temperature.
Boost
Pressing the red power button during your session will allow you to boost the temperature up to 210°C. Hold it for as long as you desire and press on either of the arrows when done so that your IQC vaporizer returns from the Boost mode to the temperature set beforehand.
Charging by USB-C
Charge your IQC vaporizer in as little as 2 hours with USB-C charging. Plus, if you're on the go and need to quickly charge your phone then its reverse charging capability is perfect for just that occasion!
App to extend customisability
DaVinci's latest innovation is a web-based app for both iOS and Android OS which enables control of the IQC not only from smartphones but also tablets and desktops.
Using the app you also can create custom “Smart Paths” to simplify your DaVinci IQC sessions by creating, naming and saving automatic temperature adjustments.
What’s the difference between DaVinci IQC and IQ2?
The IQ2 and the IQC are very similar vaporizers. The major differences are that IQC has USB-C charging, as well as a soft material mouthpiece with an accompanying flavour chamber lid and water pipe adapter. It is however lacking dose tracking and AirDial technology which the DaVinci IQ2 has.
Warranty
All DaVinci IQC vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DaVinci, are completely authentic and backed by a 5-year warranty on the device and a 1-year warranty on the battery.

Who is the DaVinci IQC for?
The DaVinci IQC is for those who want to be in full control of their vaping sessions. There are many features that make it perfect for experimenting and experience different vapour flavours, like its zirconia flavour chamber, different heating modes and large temperature range. The precision mode also makes it easy to explore all available temperatures (0 to 221°C) without any hassle!
Sealed vapour path of Zirconia/glass
DaVinci's most recent innovation is a vapour path that has been sealed with zirconia and glass. This means no metals or plastics will come in contact with your vapour which ensures that you will only experience pure and tasteful sessions with the IQC!
Exceptional flavour
DaVinci's oven is like no other. The DaVinci IQC’s glass-lined ceramic oven boasts a temperature control system with a 1-degree accuracy and offers precision mode for the ultimate degree control as well as a “Smart Path” mode which provides an easy-to-use yet practical way of experimenting with pre-set temperature increases.
Powerful and removable battery
The DaVinci IQC comes with a 18650, 3000 mAh rechargeable battery that is able to provide up to 2 hours of run time. This makes it a perfect companion for those outdoor days or long trips without access to power outlets.
The battery is replaceable too, so if you are going to be out for a while, carry some extras—you never know when they will come in handy!
You can use the up and down buttons to see how much battery power your vaporizer has left. It will also vibrate when there is only 10% of the battery remaining.
Can connect to water tools
The IQC comes with a water pipe adapter that can be hooked up to any 10 mm water pipe for an even smoother and cleaner vapour experience. Letting the vapour pass through a water tool allows it to cool down and easier to consume.
3 modes to control the temperature
“Smart Path”
With the “Smart Path” mode on your DaVinci IQC, you can use four different settings that will gradually increase the temperature in the ceramic oven. The first setting is called "Flavour" and it starts at 176°C before finishing at 188°C after 8 minutes.
There are three other modes: Mind, Body and Rest which start at different temperatures and finish 8 minutes later with a 12°C higher temperature.
Precision
This mode allows you to be in control of the temperature down to a single degree. To enter precision mode, click on the power button once which will show the current temperature and then adjust it with up and down arrows to pick your preferred temperature.
Boost
Pressing the red power button during your session will allow you to boost the temperature up to 210°C. Hold it for as long as you desire and press on either of the arrows when done so that your IQC vaporizer returns from the Boost mode to the temperature set beforehand.
Charging by USB-C
Charge your IQC vaporizer in as little as 2 hours with USB-C charging. Plus, if you're on the go and need to quickly charge your phone then its reverse charging capability is perfect for just that occasion!
App to extend customisability
DaVinci's latest innovation is a web-based app for both iOS and Android OS which enables control of the IQC not only from smartphones but also tablets and desktops.
Using the app you also can create custom “Smart Paths” to simplify your DaVinci IQC sessions by creating, naming and saving automatic temperature adjustments.
What’s the difference between DaVinci IQC and IQ2?
The IQ2 and the IQC are very similar vaporizers. The major differences are that IQC has USB-C charging, as well as a soft material mouthpiece with an accompanying flavour chamber lid and water pipe adapter. It is however lacking dose tracking and AirDial technology which the DaVinci IQ2 has.
Warranty
All DaVinci IQC vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DaVinci, are completely authentic and backed by a 5-year warranty on the device and a 1-year warranty on the battery.

Who is Wolkenkraft ÄRiS for?
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is a vaporizer designed in Germany that delivers absolutely incredible vapour. It provides users a lot of flexibility with the precise control of temperature and capability of vaping both herbs and concentrates. Other than the amazing vapour quality, what makes it stand out is the air path which is both detachable and see through, making very easy to clean.
There are vaporizers on the market that are well above the price of the ÄRiS that cannot match its performance or quality. We think that Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is a great portable vaporizer that is suitable for both beginners and experienced users as both the vapour quality and flexibility are outstanding.
Top vapour quality
The vapour generated by the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is simply amazing. The herbs or concentrates are mixed with clean fresh air through the heating process thanks to the innovative convection system, resulting in the vapour that is both pure and perfectly cooled.
High quality construction
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS looks modern and when it comes to the quality of materials, you won't find any compromises. High quality materials are not only visible, but you can also feel them to the touch.
Extendable mouthpiece
The mouthpiece of the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is made of thick Pyrex glass which means it’s super durable and guaranteed to last for years. It is easy to detach from the device and can then be cleaned in isopropyl alcohol. The mouthpiece is also extendable, meaning you can pull it out to extend the vapour path and cool down the vapour further before you consume it.
Compact size
As the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is just 5.2 cm wide, 8.4 cm tall and 2.5 cm deep it fits in most pockets and bags - perfect if you enjoy vaping outside. Not only is it small and discreet, but it also fits nicely in the palm of your hand when you’re using it.
Easy to clean air path
The most innovative feature of the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is the patented air path structure which means that you can detach it and access the air path for effortless cleaning. Normally, you can only clean the screen and the mouthpiece of a vape, but with the ÄRiS you can also easily clean the see-through and detachable air path.
Precise temperature settings
With the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS, you can select any temperature you want from 160 to 221°C, with a 1°C precision. If you enjoy smooth, flavourful vapour you should use the temperatures under 200°C, and if you want to get everything out from your herbs, with less flavour but more potency, you should heat it to the higher temperatures.
Haptic feedback
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS lets you know when it has been turned on or off, and when it has heated up to your selected temperature, by a short vibration. No need to look at the display, you can simply feel what the vape is doing!
Easy to use
It’s very easy to use the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS as it only has three buttons. The largest one is used for switching it on and off, and the other two, a plus and a minus button, are used to change temperature or session time.
Session timer
To prevent unnecessary battery drainage there is a session timer function that activates and powers down the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS after 5 minutes of inactivity. The session timer can be set to 3, 4, 5 or 6 minutes by holding the power button for about 2 seconds and select the session time you want with the plus and minus buttons.
Fast heat-up time
You will not have to wait for long to start your vape sessions with the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS as it can reach vaporization temperatures in just 25 seconds! Simply power it up, select your temperature and wait for it vibrate to indicate it’s ready to vape your material.
Scratch-resistant OLED display
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS has a 0.96-inch crystal clear dual display on the top side. The top display shows three things: the actual temperature, the selected temperature and the battery level. The bottom display shows the current session time and the set session time. Thanks to the size of the display, all relevant information is clearly visible at all times.
Strong battery
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is equipped with a powerful 2300 mAh battery, which lasts for many sessions because the new convection system needs less energy to heat the materials. Charging it from zero to full takes around 90 minutes.
Warranty
All Wolkenkraft ÄRiS sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Wolkenkraft products, are authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is Wolkenkraft ÄRiS for?
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is a vaporizer designed in Germany that delivers absolutely incredible vapour. It provides users a lot of flexibility with the precise control of temperature and capability of vaping both herbs and concentrates. Other than the amazing vapour quality, what makes it stand out is the air path which is both detachable and see through, making very easy to clean.
There are vaporizers on the market that are well above the price of the ÄRiS that cannot match its performance or quality. We think that Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is a great portable vaporizer that is suitable for both beginners and experienced users as both the vapour quality and flexibility are outstanding.
Top vapour quality
The vapour generated by the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is simply amazing. The herbs or concentrates are mixed with clean fresh air through the heating process thanks to the innovative convection system, resulting in the vapour that is both pure and perfectly cooled.
High quality construction
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS looks modern and when it comes to the quality of materials, you won't find any compromises. High quality materials are not only visible, but you can also feel them to the touch.
Extendable mouthpiece
The mouthpiece of the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is made of thick Pyrex glass which means it’s super durable and guaranteed to last for years. It is easy to detach from the device and can then be cleaned in isopropyl alcohol. The mouthpiece is also extendable, meaning you can pull it out to extend the vapour path and cool down the vapour further before you consume it.
Compact size
As the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is just 5.2 cm wide, 8.4 cm tall and 2.5 cm deep it fits in most pockets and bags - perfect if you enjoy vaping outside. Not only is it small and discreet, but it also fits nicely in the palm of your hand when you’re using it.
Easy to clean air path
The most innovative feature of the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is the patented air path structure which means that you can detach it and access the air path for effortless cleaning. Normally, you can only clean the screen and the mouthpiece of a vape, but with the ÄRiS you can also easily clean the see-through and detachable air path.
Precise temperature settings
With the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS, you can select any temperature you want from 160 to 221°C, with a 1°C precision. If you enjoy smooth, flavourful vapour you should use the temperatures under 200°C, and if you want to get everything out from your herbs, with less flavour but more potency, you should heat it to the higher temperatures.
Haptic feedback
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS lets you know when it has been turned on or off, and when it has heated up to your selected temperature, by a short vibration. No need to look at the display, you can simply feel what the vape is doing!
Easy to use
It’s very easy to use the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS as it only has three buttons. The largest one is used for switching it on and off, and the other two, a plus and a minus button, are used to change temperature or session time.
Session timer
To prevent unnecessary battery drainage there is a session timer function that activates and powers down the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS after 5 minutes of inactivity. The session timer can be set to 3, 4, 5 or 6 minutes by holding the power button for about 2 seconds and select the session time you want with the plus and minus buttons.
Fast heat-up time
You will not have to wait for long to start your vape sessions with the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS as it can reach vaporization temperatures in just 25 seconds! Simply power it up, select your temperature and wait for it vibrate to indicate it’s ready to vape your material.
Scratch-resistant OLED display
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS has a 0.96-inch crystal clear dual display on the top side. The top display shows three things: the actual temperature, the selected temperature and the battery level. The bottom display shows the current session time and the set session time. Thanks to the size of the display, all relevant information is clearly visible at all times.
Strong battery
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is equipped with a powerful 2300 mAh battery, which lasts for many sessions because the new convection system needs less energy to heat the materials. Charging it from zero to full takes around 90 minutes.
Warranty
All Wolkenkraft ÄRiS sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Wolkenkraft products, are authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is Wolkenkraft ÄRiS for?
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is a vaporizer designed in Germany that delivers absolutely incredible vapour. It provides users a lot of flexibility with the precise control of temperature and capability of vaping both herbs and concentrates. Other than the amazing vapour quality, what makes it stand out is the air path which is both detachable and see through, making very easy to clean.
There are vaporizers on the market that are well above the price of the ÄRiS that cannot match its performance or quality. We think that Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is a great portable vaporizer that is suitable for both beginners and experienced users as both the vapour quality and flexibility are outstanding.
Top vapour quality
The vapour generated by the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is simply amazing. The herbs or concentrates are mixed with clean fresh air through the heating process thanks to the innovative convection system, resulting in the vapour that is both pure and perfectly cooled.
High quality construction
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS looks modern and when it comes to the quality of materials, you won't find any compromises. High quality materials are not only visible, but you can also feel them to the touch.
Extendable mouthpiece
The mouthpiece of the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is made of thick Pyrex glass which means it’s super durable and guaranteed to last for years. It is easy to detach from the device and can then be cleaned in isopropyl alcohol. The mouthpiece is also extendable, meaning you can pull it out to extend the vapour path and cool down the vapour further before you consume it.
Compact size
As the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is just 5.2 cm wide, 8.4 cm tall and 2.5 cm deep it fits in most pockets and bags - perfect if you enjoy vaping outside. Not only is it small and discreet, but it also fits nicely in the palm of your hand when you’re using it.
Easy to clean air path
The most innovative feature of the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is the patented air path structure which means that you can detach it and access the air path for effortless cleaning. Normally, you can only clean the screen and the mouthpiece of a vape, but with the ÄRiS you can also easily clean the see-through and detachable air path.
Precise temperature settings
With the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS, you can select any temperature you want from 160 to 221°C, with a 1°C precision. If you enjoy smooth, flavourful vapour you should use the temperatures under 200°C, and if you want to get everything out from your herbs, with less flavour but more potency, you should heat it to the higher temperatures.
Haptic feedback
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS lets you know when it has been turned on or off, and when it has heated up to your selected temperature, by a short vibration. No need to look at the display, you can simply feel what the vape is doing!
Easy to use
It’s very easy to use the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS as it only has three buttons. The largest one is used for switching it on and off, and the other two, a plus and a minus button, are used to change temperature or session time.
Session timer
To prevent unnecessary battery drainage there is a session timer function that activates and powers down the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS after 5 minutes of inactivity. The session timer can be set to 3, 4, 5 or 6 minutes by holding the power button for about 2 seconds and select the session time you want with the plus and minus buttons.
Fast heat-up time
You will not have to wait for long to start your vape sessions with the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS as it can reach vaporization temperatures in just 25 seconds! Simply power it up, select your temperature and wait for it vibrate to indicate it’s ready to vape your material.
Scratch-resistant OLED display
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS has a 0.96-inch crystal clear dual display on the top side. The top display shows three things: the actual temperature, the selected temperature and the battery level. The bottom display shows the current session time and the set session time. Thanks to the size of the display, all relevant information is clearly visible at all times.
Strong battery
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is equipped with a powerful 2300 mAh battery, which lasts for many sessions because the new convection system needs less energy to heat the materials. Charging it from zero to full takes around 90 minutes.
Warranty
All Wolkenkraft ÄRiS sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Wolkenkraft products, are authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is Wolkenkraft ÄRiS for?
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is a vaporizer designed in Germany that delivers absolutely incredible vapour. It provides users a lot of flexibility with the precise control of temperature and capability of vaping both herbs and concentrates. Other than the amazing vapour quality, what makes it stand out is the air path which is both detachable and see through, making very easy to clean.
There are vaporizers on the market that are well above the price of the ÄRiS that cannot match its performance or quality. We think that Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is a great portable vaporizer that is suitable for both beginners and experienced users as both the vapour quality and flexibility are outstanding.
Top vapour quality
The vapour generated by the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is simply amazing. The herbs or concentrates are mixed with clean fresh air through the heating process thanks to the innovative convection system, resulting in the vapour that is both pure and perfectly cooled.
High quality construction
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS looks modern and when it comes to the quality of materials, you won't find any compromises. High quality materials are not only visible, but you can also feel them to the touch.
Extendable mouthpiece
The mouthpiece of the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is made of thick Pyrex glass which means it’s super durable and guaranteed to last for years. It is easy to detach from the device and can then be cleaned in isopropyl alcohol. The mouthpiece is also extendable, meaning you can pull it out to extend the vapour path and cool down the vapour further before you consume it.
Compact size
As the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is just 5.2 cm wide, 8.4 cm tall and 2.5 cm deep it fits in most pockets and bags - perfect if you enjoy vaping outside. Not only is it small and discreet, but it also fits nicely in the palm of your hand when you’re using it.
Easy to clean air path
The most innovative feature of the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is the patented air path structure which means that you can detach it and access the air path for effortless cleaning. Normally, you can only clean the screen and the mouthpiece of a vape, but with the ÄRiS you can also easily clean the see-through and detachable air path.
Precise temperature settings
With the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS, you can select any temperature you want from 160 to 221°C, with a 1°C precision. If you enjoy smooth, flavourful vapour you should use the temperatures under 200°C, and if you want to get everything out from your herbs, with less flavour but more potency, you should heat it to the higher temperatures.
Haptic feedback
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS lets you know when it has been turned on or off, and when it has heated up to your selected temperature, by a short vibration. No need to look at the display, you can simply feel what the vape is doing!
Easy to use
It’s very easy to use the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS as it only has three buttons. The largest one is used for switching it on and off, and the other two, a plus and a minus button, are used to change temperature or session time.
Session timer
To prevent unnecessary battery drainage there is a session timer function that activates and powers down the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS after 5 minutes of inactivity. The session timer can be set to 3, 4, 5 or 6 minutes by holding the power button for about 2 seconds and select the session time you want with the plus and minus buttons.
Fast heat-up time
You will not have to wait for long to start your vape sessions with the Wolkenkraft ÄRiS as it can reach vaporization temperatures in just 25 seconds! Simply power it up, select your temperature and wait for it vibrate to indicate it’s ready to vape your material.
Scratch-resistant OLED display
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS has a 0.96-inch crystal clear dual display on the top side. The top display shows three things: the actual temperature, the selected temperature and the battery level. The bottom display shows the current session time and the set session time. Thanks to the size of the display, all relevant information is clearly visible at all times.
Strong battery
The Wolkenkraft ÄRiS is equipped with a powerful 2300 mAh battery, which lasts for many sessions because the new convection system needs less energy to heat the materials. Charging it from zero to full takes around 90 minutes.
Warranty
All Wolkenkraft ÄRiS sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Wolkenkraft products, are authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Newest version (2023.07)
Made of Italian olive wood

Environmentally friendly
Who is the Vapman vaporizer for?
The Vapman brings together elements of traditional Italian craftsmanship with modern Swiss design. The exterior of olive wood stunningly beautiful, and thanks to ingenious craftsmanship it's both efficient and easy to use.
As it is a manually heated vape, all you need is the Vapman, a lighter, and your herbs, which makes it perfect for outdoor activities, especially hiking. If you are looking for a versatile vape that's easy to carry around and prepare, with no batteries or cables, the Vapman vaporizer is perfect for you.
What's the difference between Vapman Classic and Vapman Pure?
The Vapman Classic features a special coating of mica, a completely harmless mineral that has been used for years in cooking, that acts as an effective heat reflector and prevents carbonization of the wood. The coating both increases the efficiency and keeps your Vapman looking as beautiful as the day you got it.
Gold-plated copper heating chamber
The Gold-plated copper heating chamber is shaped to perfection which leads to excellent heat conduction and rapid, even vaporization. The built-in brass nozzles of the heating chamber prevent inhalation of butane gas while delivering fresh air into the chamber.
Made from Italian olive wood
The grip ring encasing the heating chamber is made from olive wood, as it's an environmentally friendly material and comes from Italy where the Vapman is manufactured. Wood has been found to be a perfect material for vaporizers because it absorbs heat and poses no risk, while also being sustainable as well as beautiful!
The sleek design guarantees safe use and comfortable handling; this way you can focus on taking deep breaths without worrying about burning yourself with hot metal or plastic components.
Adjustable vapour density
The centrepiece, which you put on top of the heating chamber and attach the mouthpiece to, is also made of olive wood and has three optimally positioned air holes that provide fresh air. For even denser vapour clouds, cover one or more holes with your fingers.
The screen and heat protection ring are underneath the centrepiece and can easily be removed for deep cleaning.
Available mouthpieces
When buying a Vapman you’re also selecting a mouthpiece. Here are the five materials you can choose from:
P.O.M plastic
P.O.M plastic has long been a favourite choice for vape enthusiasts who want to enjoy their hobby without worrying about glass that breaks or other delicate materials that are typically used in mouthpieces. With its durability, easy cleaning properties, and resistance against high temperatures - up until 120°C you can rest assured that your mouthpiece will stand the test of time.
Inox
Inox is a premium stainless steel with an excellent finish. This mouthpiece went through several production steps to achieve this quality which enables optimal cleanability and maximum hygiene for users who want the best of both worlds: easy cleaning without compromising on quality!
Olive wood
Wood is not only an excellent material for the grip and centrepiece, but it's also a great option of material for a mouthpiece. The olive wood mouthpiece impresses with its light weight that allows for an easy to consume the vapour from your Vapman while giving you a great taste experience all at once!
Titanium
The king of metals, titanium, is strong and lightweight. It scores at the highest levels for hygiene while still satisfying all other requirements. Its full beauty can be seen through its optimal surface treatment that matches the design of the Vapman.
Handmade borosilicate glass
Borosilicate glass is a very hygienic material that does not contain harmful chemicals or leave a taste. It neither discolours nor absorbs odours and it is also 100% recyclable! The longer vapour path and cooling properties of the glass means that you get an even more comfortable and cooler vapour.
The borosilicate glass mouthpiece is not included in any kit and has to be bought separately.
How to use the Vapman
Twist the upper part counter-clockwise to access the chamber.
Fill the chamber with herbs (with or without the help of the filling funnel).
Install the upper part again.
Turn the Vapman to the side and use a lighter to heat the golden heating chamber.
After a few seconds, turn it back and enjoy the vapour by inhaling it from the mouthpiece.
The temperature your herbs will be heated to depend on how long you heat the heating chamber. If the vapour feels harsh and hot it means you have heated for too long and if the vapour doesn't have enough taste you can heat a bit more. After some time, you'll get a feeling for your personal preferences of the vapour.
As soon as there is no more taste, you can check the status of your herbs. When the herb colour turns dark brown and they smell rusty, they no longer contain active ingredients and can be removed.
Environmentally friendly
As the Vapman only uses a lighter for heat, no electrical components or batteries are needed, making it very environmentally friendly! Plus, all parts of the Vapman can be replaced so it will last forever with proper care.
Warranty
All Vapman vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Vapman products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty restricted to normal use.

Who is the Vapman vaporizer for?
The Vapman brings together elements of traditional Italian craftsmanship with modern Swiss design. The exterior of olive wood stunningly beautiful, and thanks to ingenious craftsmanship it's both efficient and easy to use.
As it is a manually heated vape, all you need is the Vapman, a lighter, and your herbs, which makes it perfect for outdoor activities, especially hiking. If you are looking for a versatile vape that's easy to carry around and prepare, with no batteries or cables, the Vapman vaporizer is perfect for you.
What's the difference between Vapman Classic and Vapman Pure?
The Vapman Classic features a special coating of mica, a completely harmless mineral that has been used for years in cooking, that acts as an effective heat reflector and prevents carbonization of the wood. The coating both increases the efficiency and keeps your Vapman looking as beautiful as the day you got it.
Gold-plated copper heating chamber
The Gold-plated copper heating chamber is shaped to perfection which leads to excellent heat conduction and rapid, even vaporization. The built-in brass nozzles of the heating chamber prevent inhalation of butane gas while delivering fresh air into the chamber.
Made from Italian olive wood
The grip ring encasing the heating chamber is made from olive wood, as it's an environmentally friendly material and comes from Italy where the Vapman is manufactured. Wood has been found to be a perfect material for vaporizers because it absorbs heat and poses no risk, while also being sustainable as well as beautiful!
The sleek design guarantees safe use and comfortable handling; this way you can focus on taking deep breaths without worrying about burning yourself with hot metal or plastic components.
Adjustable vapour density
The centrepiece, which you put on top of the heating chamber and attach the mouthpiece to, is also made of olive wood and has three optimally positioned air holes that provide fresh air. For even denser vapour clouds, cover one or more holes with your fingers.
The screen and heat protection ring are underneath the centrepiece and can easily be removed for deep cleaning.
Available mouthpieces
When buying a Vapman you’re also selecting a mouthpiece. Here are the five materials you can choose from:
P.O.M plastic
P.O.M plastic has long been a favourite choice for vape enthusiasts who want to enjoy their hobby without worrying about glass that breaks or other delicate materials that are typically used in mouthpieces. With its durability, easy cleaning properties, and resistance against high temperatures - up until 120°C you can rest assured that your mouthpiece will stand the test of time.
Inox
Inox is a premium stainless steel with an excellent finish. This mouthpiece went through several production steps to achieve this quality which enables optimal cleanability and maximum hygiene for users who want the best of both worlds: easy cleaning without compromising on quality!
Olive wood
Wood is not only an excellent material for the grip and centrepiece, but it's also a great option of material for a mouthpiece. The olive wood mouthpiece impresses with its light weight that allows for an easy to consume the vapour from your Vapman while giving you a great taste experience all at once!
Titanium
The king of metals, titanium, is strong and lightweight. It scores at the highest levels for hygiene while still satisfying all other requirements. Its full beauty can be seen through its optimal surface treatment that matches the design of the Vapman.
Handmade borosilicate glass
Borosilicate glass is a very hygienic material that does not contain harmful chemicals or leave a taste. It neither discolours nor absorbs odours and it is also 100% recyclable! The longer vapour path and cooling properties of the glass means that you get an even more comfortable and cooler vapour.
The borosilicate glass mouthpiece is not included in any kit and has to be bought separately.
How to use the Vapman
Twist the upper part counter-clockwise to access the chamber.
Fill the chamber with herbs (with or without the help of the filling funnel).
Install the upper part again.
Turn the Vapman to the side and use a lighter to heat the golden heating chamber.
After a few seconds, turn it back and enjoy the vapour by inhaling it from the mouthpiece.
The temperature your herbs will be heated to depend on how long you heat the heating chamber. If the vapour feels harsh and hot it means you have heated for too long and if the vapour doesn't have enough taste you can heat a bit more. After some time, you'll get a feeling for your personal preferences of the vapour.
As soon as there is no more taste, you can check the status of your herbs. When the herb colour turns dark brown and they smell rusty, they no longer contain active ingredients and can be removed.
Environmentally friendly
As the Vapman only uses a lighter for heat, no electrical components or batteries are needed, making it very environmentally friendly! Plus, all parts of the Vapman can be replaced so it will last forever with proper care.
Warranty
All Vapman vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Vapman products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty restricted to normal use.

Who is the DaVinci IQ2 for?
If you are on the hunt for a portable vape with the latest technology that can vaporize both herbs and concentrates then you should consider the DaVinci IQ2. It’s slightly larger than its predecessor, the DaVinci IQ, but it comes with some new useful features such as adjustable airflow levels and dosing control, perfect for medicinal users who might need exact dosages. The battery is removable and lasts for up to 8 sessions per charge which means it’s a good match for people who value portability and vaping when away from home.
Dosage Control
Dosage control is DaVinci Technologies latest innovation and with it, you can have full control over how much you have vaped - a very important feature if you are looking to get consistent results with every session. Simply input the strain potency and the amount of your herb or extract that you have put in the oven to have the DaVinci IQ2 track and report dose per draw and session. If you access the app [currently Android only], you can even set a maximum dose which will trigger an alert when reached.
Adjustable Airflow
The DaVinci IQ2 lets you adjust the airflow with the new Air Dial™-system which enables you to choose how dense you want the vapour to be. If you prefer cool vapour, increase the airflow, and if you prefer denser vapour, decrease the airflow. In total there are five dial settings for you to experiment with to find the vapour best suited for your style.
Always Maximum Flavour
It takes less than a minute for the DaVinci IQ2 to heat up, which means you will never be left waiting for long before it’s time to go. Insert a dosage pod (up to 0,2 g) or add your material straight in the adjustable oven (up to 0,5 g) and start the heating process. After the vapour is generated it passes through the ceramic air path which in combination with the zirconia and glass-lined oven ensures unprecedented purity and flavour.
Removable Battery
The DaVinci IQ2 comes with a 3000 mAh Li-Ion 18650 battery, the same type that is in the original DaVinci IQ. Fully charged, the battery can give you a solid hour of vaporization, which is approximately 6 to 8 sessions. As it’s also removable, you can easily just swap out the battery for a spare one to keep your sessions going longer. The battery takes 6 hours to charge via micro-USB, but only 3 hours with an external charger (not included).
Functions
Two modes can be triggered via the buttons to adjust the behaviour of the DaVinci IQ2:
Stealth mode - dims the LED-lights on the front of the device.
Boost mode - quickly boosts the temperature in the oven up to 220°C.
To set the temperature of the DaVinci IQ2 there are also two options:
Precision mode - set your desired temperature and DaVinci IQ2 will maintain it.
Smart path - increase the temperature gradually, choose from one of four pre-set smart paths, or customize your own via the app.
Warranty
All DaVinci IQ2 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DaVinci, are completely authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty on the device and a 1-year warranty on the battery.

Who is the DaVinci IQ2 for?
If you are on the hunt for a portable vape with the latest technology that can vaporize both herbs and concentrates then you should consider the DaVinci IQ2. It’s slightly larger than its predecessor, the DaVinci IQ, but it comes with some new useful features such as adjustable airflow levels and dosing control, perfect for medicinal users who might need exact dosages. The battery is removable and lasts for up to 8 sessions per charge which means it’s a good match for people who value portability and vaping when away from home.
Dosage Control
Dosage control is DaVinci Technologies latest innovation and with it, you can have full control over how much you have vaped - a very important feature if you are looking to get consistent results with every session. Simply input the strain potency and the amount of your herb or extract that you have put in the oven to have the DaVinci IQ2 track and report dose per draw and session. If you access the app [currently Android only], you can even set a maximum dose which will trigger an alert when reached.
Adjustable Airflow
The DaVinci IQ2 lets you adjust the airflow with the new Air Dial™-system which enables you to choose how dense you want the vapour to be. If you prefer cool vapour, increase the airflow, and if you prefer denser vapour, decrease the airflow. In total there are five dial settings for you to experiment with to find the vapour best suited for your style.
Always Maximum Flavour
It takes less than a minute for the DaVinci IQ2 to heat up, which means you will never be left waiting for long before it’s time to go. Insert a dosage pod (up to 0,2 g) or add your material straight in the adjustable oven (up to 0,5 g) and start the heating process. After the vapour is generated it passes through the ceramic air path which in combination with the zirconia and glass-lined oven ensures unprecedented purity and flavour.
Removable Battery
The DaVinci IQ2 comes with a 3000 mAh Li-Ion 18650 battery, the same type that is in the original DaVinci IQ. Fully charged, the battery can give you a solid hour of vaporization, which is approximately 6 to 8 sessions. As it’s also removable, you can easily just swap out the battery for a spare one to keep your sessions going longer. The battery takes 6 hours to charge via micro-USB, but only 3 hours with an external charger (not included).
Functions
Two modes can be triggered via the buttons to adjust the behaviour of the DaVinci IQ2:
Stealth mode - dims the LED-lights on the front of the device.
Boost mode - quickly boosts the temperature in the oven up to 220°C.
To set the temperature of the DaVinci IQ2 there are also two options:
Precision mode - set your desired temperature and DaVinci IQ2 will maintain it.
Smart path - increase the temperature gradually, choose from one of four pre-set smart paths, or customize your own via the app.
Warranty
All DaVinci IQ2 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DaVinci, are completely authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty on the device and a 1-year warranty on the battery.

Who is the DaVinci IQ2 for?
If you are on the hunt for a portable vape with the latest technology that can vaporize both herbs and concentrates then you should consider the DaVinci IQ2. It’s slightly larger than its predecessor, the DaVinci IQ, but it comes with some new useful features such as adjustable airflow levels and dosing control, perfect for medicinal users who might need exact dosages. The battery is removable and lasts for up to 8 sessions per charge which means it’s a good match for people who value portability and vaping when away from home.
Dosage Control
Dosage control is DaVinci Technologies latest innovation and with it, you can have full control over how much you have vaped - a very important feature if you are looking to get consistent results with every session. Simply input the strain potency and the amount of your herb or extract that you have put in the oven to have the DaVinci IQ2 track and report dose per draw and session. If you access the app [currently Android only], you can even set a maximum dose which will trigger an alert when reached.
Adjustable Airflow
The DaVinci IQ2 lets you adjust the airflow with the new Air Dial™-system which enables you to choose how dense you want the vapour to be. If you prefer cool vapour, increase the airflow, and if you prefer denser vapour, decrease the airflow. In total there are five dial settings for you to experiment with to find the vapour best suited for your style.
Always Maximum Flavour
It takes less than a minute for the DaVinci IQ2 to heat up, which means you will never be left waiting for long before it’s time to go. Insert a dosage pod (up to 0,2 g) or add your material straight in the adjustable oven (up to 0,5 g) and start the heating process. After the vapour is generated it passes through the ceramic air path which in combination with the zirconia and glass-lined oven ensures unprecedented purity and flavour.
Removable Battery
The DaVinci IQ2 comes with a 3000 mAh Li-Ion 18650 battery, the same type that is in the original DaVinci IQ. Fully charged, the battery can give you a solid hour of vaporization, which is approximately 6 to 8 sessions. As it’s also removable, you can easily just swap out the battery for a spare one to keep your sessions going longer. The battery takes 6 hours to charge via micro-USB, but only 3 hours with an external charger (not included).
Functions
Two modes can be triggered via the buttons to adjust the behaviour of the DaVinci IQ2:
Stealth mode - dims the LED-lights on the front of the device.
Boost mode - quickly boosts the temperature in the oven up to 220°C.
To set the temperature of the DaVinci IQ2 there are also two options:
Precision mode - set your desired temperature and DaVinci IQ2 will maintain it.
Smart path - increase the temperature gradually, choose from one of four pre-set smart paths, or customize your own via the app.
Warranty
All DaVinci IQ2 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DaVinci, are completely authentic and backed by a 10-year warranty on the device and a 1-year warranty on the battery.

Who is the DaVinci MIQRO-C for?
If you’re seeking a simple yet effective portable vaporizer that performs to an impressively high standard, the DaVinci MIQRO-C is for you. Specifically designed with practicality and discreetness in mind, this vape can easily slip into virtually any pocket or bag – perfect for taking on-the-go! With many useful features such as an adjustable oven, fast heating time and multiple temperature settings, the DaVinci MIQRO-C guarantees a truly unique vaping experience.
Compact & Discreet
The DaVinci MIQRO-C is considered one of the smallest vaporizers on the market, making it a brilliant choice for those who love taking hits and experiencing vaping away from home. Guaranteed to fit into virtually any sized pocket, purse or bag with ease, the DaVinci MIQRO-C boasts a contemporary sleek design and is available in a choice of 5 colours.
Rich Flavour
The DaVinci MIQRO-C has been carefully crafted with true authentic flavours in mind, guaranteeing you’ll inhale vapour that’s a true representation of the herbs you’ve chosen to use. Utilizing a cutting-edge Zirconium airway alongside a ceramic oven, the flavours produced within your vapour clouds are certain to be rich and enjoyable. Better still, the DaVinci MIQRO-C’s bespoke air path provides a powerful cooling effect to the vapour before it reaches your lips, guaranteeing maximum comfort with each draw.
Multiple Temperature Settings
A hugely versatile feature of the DaVinci MIQRO-C is its numerous temperature settings, allowing you to customise your session each time. Including an innovative boost mode, Smart Paths and precise temperature control up to 220°C, the DaVinci MIQRO-C is sophisticated and varied. Better still, this vape can fully heat-up in less than 40 seconds, meaning you’ll never be left waiting minutes on end to take a hit.
Adjustable Oven Size
The DaVinci MIQRO-C gives you the chance to adjust its oven size by up to an impressive 50%. Allowing you to truly tailor the function of your vape to suit your requirements, the ability to decrease the oven size helps you get the most out of your herbs – especially when you don’t have much to load. Helping achieve a stronger hit and ensuring every single part of your herbs is heated to perfection, the DaVinci MIQRO-C adjustable oven is a stand-out feature.
Swappable Battery
Provided you have fully-charged replacement ready to go, the session length you can experience with the DaVinci MIQRO-C is virtually endless! Whilst this vape can provide up to 30 minutes of continuous vaping from a fully charged battery, this doesn’t mean your session has to stop there. Simply swap-in a new charged battery and you can continue with ease – no time-consuming charging required in between.

Who is the DaVinci MIQRO-C for?
If you’re seeking a simple yet effective portable vaporizer that performs to an impressively high standard, the DaVinci MIQRO-C is for you. Specifically designed with practicality and discreetness in mind, this vape can easily slip into virtually any pocket or bag – perfect for taking on-the-go! With many useful features such as an adjustable oven, fast heating time and multiple temperature settings, the DaVinci MIQRO-C guarantees a truly unique vaping experience.
Compact & Discreet
The DaVinci MIQRO-C is considered one of the smallest vaporizers on the market, making it a brilliant choice for those who love taking hits and experiencing vaping away from home. Guaranteed to fit into virtually any sized pocket, purse or bag with ease, the DaVinci MIQRO-C boasts a contemporary sleek design and is available in a choice of 5 colours.
Rich Flavour
The DaVinci MIQRO-C has been carefully crafted with true authentic flavours in mind, guaranteeing you’ll inhale vapour that’s a true representation of the herbs you’ve chosen to use. Utilizing a cutting-edge Zirconium airway alongside a ceramic oven, the flavours produced within your vapour clouds are certain to be rich and enjoyable. Better still, the DaVinci MIQRO-C’s bespoke air path provides a powerful cooling effect to the vapour before it reaches your lips, guaranteeing maximum comfort with each draw.
Multiple Temperature Settings
A hugely versatile feature of the DaVinci MIQRO-C is its numerous temperature settings, allowing you to customise your session each time. Including an innovative boost mode, Smart Paths and precise temperature control up to 220°C, the DaVinci MIQRO-C is sophisticated and varied. Better still, this vape can fully heat-up in less than 40 seconds, meaning you’ll never be left waiting minutes on end to take a hit.
Adjustable Oven Size
The DaVinci MIQRO-C gives you the chance to adjust its oven size by up to an impressive 50%. Allowing you to truly tailor the function of your vape to suit your requirements, the ability to decrease the oven size helps you get the most out of your herbs – especially when you don’t have much to load. Helping achieve a stronger hit and ensuring every single part of your herbs is heated to perfection, the DaVinci MIQRO-C adjustable oven is a stand-out feature.
Swappable Battery
Provided you have fully-charged replacement ready to go, the session length you can experience with the DaVinci MIQRO-C is virtually endless! Whilst this vape can provide up to 30 minutes of continuous vaping from a fully charged battery, this doesn’t mean your session has to stop there. Simply swap-in a new charged battery and you can continue with ease – no time-consuming charging required in between.

Who is the Boundless Vexil for?
Boundless Vexil is a portable vaporizer that features four pre-set temperatures and a chamber that holds up to 0.5 gram of herb. It is good for both experienced and for those who are new to vaping and offer simple but powerful vaping sessions.
To ensure you get the most out of your herbs, the Vexil heats them inside its innovative conduction heating chamber that is ready to produce vapour in just 30 seconds! Perfect for those vape sessions when you want to get started quickly.
Easy to bring
While most vapes as powerful as the Vexil are big and bulky, this vape is truly pocket-sized vape making it discreet to use both at home and outside. It measures 4.5 × 2.0 × 10.8 cm and weigh 154 g, so it’s easy to bring in your pocket or in a bag.
Flavourful vapour
Boundless Vexil produces great tasting vapour because unlike other vaporizers in its price class that heat the herbs only at the tip of a metal oven, this vape's ceramic heating chamber emits even and consistent conduction heat throughout the herbs.
The unique zirconia mouthpiece ensures all vapour passes through an isolated airflow path to cool before reaching your lips and throat, which prevents harsh vapour and unpleasant tastes. Thanks to a strong magnetic connection, you also never have to worry about losing the mouthpiece when you bring the vape with you somewhere.
Four pre-set temperatures
The Vexil offers you a wide range of options when it comes to heat levels. Try out the four different temp settings: 192°C, 204°C, 212°C and finally 225°C to get the most out of your herbs!
How to use the Boundless Vexil
Remove the mouthpiece.
Fill the oven with finely ground herbs.
Attach the mouthpiece back.
Press the power button five times quickly.
See the colour of the leaf on the front to see which temperature level is set.
You can change the temperature level by pushing the up or down buttons.
When the leaf stops blinking the temperature level has been reached.
The Boundless Vexil is now producing vapour from your herbs. Enjoy!
Efficient battery
The Boundless Vexil is powered by an 1800 mAh battery that lasts around 6 sessions on one full charge. It charges through USB-C connectivity, allowing for fast and convenient recharging times.
Heat control
To save battery power, it may be convenient to temporarily turn off the heat during a session, without necessarily turning off the vaporizer. On Boundless Vexil, you can click the power button three times in quick succession to pause the heating.
Stealth mode
In stealth mode, you can use Vexil with no light indicators. To enter this mode, simply hold down the three buttons for about three seconds, after which it remains on but without any light.
Warranty
All Boundless Vexil vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Boundless, are completely authentic and backed by a 3-year warranty on the device when registered and a 90-day warranty on the battery.

Magnetic USB-C Adapter

Make charging easier and extend the longevity of your vaporizer by using this Magnetic USB-C Adapter. All you have to do is attach one part of the adapter to your vaporizer, and the other part of it to a USB-C cable. The two parts then connect easily through magnetic force and your vaporizer acts as if it was plugged in normally, but without any force of insertion needed (and it can be done with only one hand!).
The USB port is usually the most sensitive area for mechanical errors due to wear and tear, so by using this adapter you can ensure that your vaporizer will be better protected from any damage to the port.
This Magnetic USB-C Adapter is compatible with all types of vaporizers and can be used with any USB-C cable. It has a 120W / 5A capacity meaning that it's strong enough to even charge laptops.

Who is the Boundless Vexil for?
Boundless Vexil is a portable vaporizer that features four pre-set temperatures and a chamber that holds up to 0.5 gram of herb. It is good for both experienced and for those who are new to vaping and offer simple but powerful vaping sessions.
To ensure you get the most out of your herbs, the Vexil heats them inside its innovative conduction heating chamber that is ready to produce vapour in just 30 seconds! Perfect for those vape sessions when you want to get started quickly.
Easy to bring
While most vapes as powerful as the Vexil are big and bulky, this vape is truly pocket-sized vape making it discreet to use both at home and outside. It measures 4.5 × 2.0 × 10.8 cm and weigh 154 g, so it’s easy to bring in your pocket or in a bag.
Flavourful vapour
Boundless Vexil produces great tasting vapour because unlike other vaporizers in its price class that heat the herbs only at the tip of a metal oven, this vape's ceramic heating chamber emits even and consistent conduction heat throughout the herbs.
The unique zirconia mouthpiece ensures all vapour passes through an isolated airflow path to cool before reaching your lips and throat, which prevents harsh vapour and unpleasant tastes. Thanks to a strong magnetic connection, you also never have to worry about losing the mouthpiece when you bring the vape with you somewhere.
Four pre-set temperatures
The Vexil offers you a wide range of options when it comes to heat levels. Try out the four different temp settings: 192°C, 204°C, 212°C and finally 225°C to get the most out of your herbs!
How to use the Boundless Vexil
Remove the mouthpiece.
Fill the oven with finely ground herbs.
Attach the mouthpiece back.
Press the power button five times quickly.
See the colour of the leaf on the front to see which temperature level is set.
You can change the temperature level by pushing the up or down buttons.
When the leaf stops blinking the temperature level has been reached.
The Boundless Vexil is now producing vapour from your herbs. Enjoy!
Efficient battery
The Boundless Vexil is powered by an 1800 mAh battery that lasts around 6 sessions on one full charge. It charges through USB-C connectivity, allowing for fast and convenient recharging times.
Heat control
To save battery power, it may be convenient to temporarily turn off the heat during a session, without necessarily turning off the vaporizer. On Boundless Vexil, you can click the power button three times in quick succession to pause the heating.

Make charging easier and extend the longevity of your vaporizer by using this Magnetic USB-C Adapter. All you have to do is attach one part of the adapter to your vaporizer, and the other part of it to a USB-C cable. The two parts then connect easily through magnetic force and your vaporizer acts as if it was plugged in normally, but without any force of insertion needed (and it can be done with only one hand!).
The USB port is usually the most sensitive area for mechanical errors due to wear and tear, so by using this adapter you can ensure that your vaporizer will be better protected from any damage to the port.
This Magnetic USB-C Adapter is compatible with all types of vaporizers and can be used with any USB-C cable. It has a 120W / 5A capacity meaning that it's strong enough to even charge laptops.

Features
Newest version! (2023.07)
Large display with beautiful animations
Patented convection heating
Quick heat-up in (30 sec.)
Large ceramic herb chamber
Replaceable battery (3000 mAh)
Very easy to clean
Precise temperature control (160 to 240°C)
Who is the Smono 5 for?
If you are looking for an uncomplicated portable convection vaporizer for herbs that is both easy to use and to clean you can’t go wrong with a Smono 5. It’s not the fastest and it doesn’t have the most features, but it is a reliable and affordable option.
The simplicity of the Smono 5’s makes it a great option for beginners and the price compared to other premium convection vaporizers makes it a solid choice for those who want pure and tasty vapour, without spending a lot.
Convection heating
To maximise the taste of your herbs the Smono 5 uses a patented convection heating system. Unlike conduction heating, where the herbs themselves are heated through contact, convection heating means it’s the hot air flowing through your herbs that heats them and start the vaporizing process. It is the slightly slower way, but the herbs are heated evenly and the vapour will be full of pure flavours.
Replaceable battery
The Smono 5 uses a powerful 3000 mAh Samsung battery of the type 18650 which lasts for approximately six full 5-minute sessions on a full charge. It takes an hour and a half to charge fully via a USB-C cable, but if you don’t want to wait you can always replace it with another charged 18650 battery by simply opening the battery compartment in the bottom of the device and switch it out.
Comfortable size
Although the Smono 5 is slightly larger than the previous Smono models, it’s still small enough to fit in your pocket or bring with you in a small bag. The larger size actually makes it more comfortable to hold and to use, and as it’s thicker it also doesn’t heat up the exterior to temperatures that are uncomfortable to hold when in use.
Colour display
The feature that makes the Smono 5 stand out the most compared to other vapes is the large colour display that plays cheerful animations when heating up. To let you know the status of heating it also displays the four things that are most important in a quadratic pattern: current temperature, set temperature, session time and battery level.
Efficient heating
With the Smono 5 you can select any temperature you want between 160 and 240°C, meaning you can go for lower temperatures if you prioritise flavour, and higher temperatures if you prefer to maximise extraction. After selecting the temperature, you only have to wait around 30 seconds before it’s ready to deliver that tasty convection vapour.
Large herb chamber
If you enjoy vaping a lot of herbs per time you will appreciate the large ceramic heating chamber of the Smono 5. It measures 14 mm in diameter and 15 mm in depth, with room  for 20 ml of material (around 0.3 grams of herb) which is a lot larger than previous Smono models.
Easy to clean
Cleaning a vape is never fun and that is why the German designers of Smono 5 have made it both quick and easy. As the magnetic block with the mouthpiece detaches you can easily access the chamber for cleaning with the brush, and the rest can be cleaned with the included wipes and pipe cleaners or compressed air.
How to use the Smono 5
Begin by detaching the mouthpiece block to access the chamber. Filling the chamber is easy thanks to the funnel shape. Fill it up with the amount of herbs you want and attach the mouthpiece block again.
To start the Smono 5, press the S-button five times in rapid succession. It will now immediately start heating to the previously set temperature.
Once the Smono 5 is powered on, a session timer of 300 seconds (5 minutes) starts to ensure no battery is unnecessarily drained. To reset the session timer you can just push any of the buttons.
If you want to change the temperature, all you have to do is press the up or down-button to select any degree you want from 160 to 240°C.
Look at the display to see when the current temperature matches the set temperature, and when they do you are ready to draw in that flavourful vapour.
To power it off, either push the S-button five times in rapid succession or wait for the session timer to expire.
Warranty
All Smono 5 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Smono, are completely authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty.

Magnetic USB-C Adapter

Make charging easier and extend the longevity of your vaporizer by using this Magnetic USB-C Adapter. All you have to do is attach one part of the adapter to your vaporizer, and the other part of it to a USB-C cable. The two parts then connect easily through magnetic force and your vaporizer acts as if it was plugged in normally, but without any force of insertion needed (and it can be done with only one hand!).
The USB port is usually the most sensitive area for mechanical errors due to wear and tear, so by using this adapter you can ensure that your vaporizer will be better protected from any damage to the port.
This Magnetic USB-C Adapter is compatible with all types of vaporizers and can be used with any USB-C cable. It has a 120W / 5A capacity meaning that it's strong enough to even charge laptops.

Features
Newest version! (2023.07)
Large display with beautiful animations
Patented convection heating
Quick heat-up in (30 sec.)
Large ceramic herb chamber
Replaceable battery (3000 mAh)
Very easy to clean
Precise temperature control (160 to 240°C)
Who is the Smono 5 for?
If you are looking for an uncomplicated portable convection vaporizer for herbs that is both easy to use and to clean you can’t go wrong with a Smono 5. It’s not the fastest and it doesn’t have the most features, but it is a reliable and affordable option.
The simplicity of the Smono 5’s makes it a great option for beginners and the price compared to other premium convection vaporizers makes it a solid choice for those who want pure and tasty vapour, without spending a lot.
Convection heating
To maximise the taste of your herbs the Smono 5 uses a patented convection heating system. Unlike conduction heating, where the herbs themselves are heated through contact, convection heating means it’s the hot air flowing through your herbs that heats them and start the vaporizing process. It is the slightly slower way, but the herbs are heated evenly and the vapour will be full of pure flavours.
Replaceable battery
The Smono 5 uses a powerful 3000 mAh Samsung battery of the type 18650 which lasts for approximately six full 5-minute sessions on a full charge. It takes an hour and a half to charge fully via a USB-C cable, but if you don’t want to wait you can always replace it with another charged 18650 battery by simply opening the battery compartment in the bottom of the device and switch it out.
Comfortable size
Although the Smono 5 is slightly larger than the previous Smono models, it’s still small enough to fit in your pocket or bring with you in a small bag. The larger size actually makes it more comfortable to hold and to use, and as it’s thicker it also doesn’t heat up the exterior to temperatures that are uncomfortable to hold when in use.
Colour display
The feature that makes the Smono 5 stand out the most compared to other vapes is the large colour display that plays cheerful animations when heating up. To let you know the status of heating it also displays the four things that are most important in a quadratic pattern: current temperature, set temperature, session time and battery level.
Efficient heating
With the Smono 5 you can select any temperature you want between 160 and 240°C, meaning you can go for lower temperatures if you prioritise flavour, and higher temperatures if you prefer to maximise extraction. After selecting the temperature, you only have to wait around 30 seconds before it’s ready to deliver that tasty convection vapour.
Large herb chamber
If you enjoy vaping a lot of herbs per time you will appreciate the large ceramic heating chamber of the Smono 5. It measures 14 mm in diameter and 15 mm in depth, with room  for 20 ml of material (around 0.3 grams of herb) which is a lot larger than previous Smono models.
Easy to clean
Cleaning a vape is never fun and that is why the German designers of Smono 5 have made it both quick and easy. As the magnetic block with the mouthpiece detaches you can easily access the chamber for cleaning with the brush, and the rest can be cleaned with the included wipes and pipe cleaners or compressed air.
How to use the Smono 5
Begin by detaching the mouthpiece block to access the chamber. Filling the chamber is easy thanks to the funnel shape. Fill it up with the amount of herbs you want and attach the mouthpiece block again.
To start the Smono 5, press the S-button five times in rapid succession. It will now immediately start heating to the previously set temperature.
Once the Smono 5 is powered on, a session timer of 300 seconds (5 minutes) starts to ensure no battery is unnecessarily drained. To reset the session timer you can just push any of the buttons.
If you want to change the temperature, all you have to do is press the up or down-button to select any degree you want from 160 to 240°C.
Look at the display to see when the current temperature matches the set temperature, and when they do you are ready to draw in that flavourful vapour.
To power it off, either push the S-button five times in rapid succession or wait for the session timer to expire.
Warranty
All Smono 5 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Smono, are completely authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty.

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)
£89
£119
Features
Induction heating
Great at heating DynaVap vaporizers
Full temperature control (120°C to 425°C)
Borosilicate glass cups
Removable batteries (2 × 2900 mAh)
Safety features
The Wand by Ispire is a portable induction heater for use with concentrates, and in addition to that, it’s also great at heating the tips of DynaVap vaporizers.
What is induction heat?
Induction heat is a highly accurate, controllable, and more predictable heat source than the torches used normally used for this kind of vaping, so you’re going to experience consistency and less waste by eliminating over- or under-heating. Select any temperature you want in 5-degree increments, from 120°C to 425°C.
Wand Glass Adapter for DynaVap vaporizers
If you plan on using the Wand with a DynaVap vaporizer, we recommend getting the Wand Glass Adapter so you can lodge the tip instead of having to swirl it around for even heat. With it, you no longer need to keep an eye on it and can use it hands-free. Just sit back and wait for the “click” of the Captive Cap.
Automatic and manual mode
You can use it in one of two modes, either manual mode or automatic mode. To use it in manual mode, hold the large button down until the cup or your DynaVap reaches your set temperature.
When you first hold the button down the Wand will blink with a red light, then once you put over something metal it will engage the induction heating and pulse a white light while it’s heating up. When it arrives at your set temperature the white light will stay on, meaning you can go ahead and enjoy whatever you're heating.
To use it in automatic mode, double press the large button, and then place it on the induction cup or put your DynaVap in it. One great thing about the automatic mode is that you can take it off and on throughout the cycle and it will just re-engage the heating, so you can sort of feather the heat while in use.
Removable batteries
The Wand is powered by two replaceable 2900 mAh batteries that can be charged with the included USB-C cable, or externally if you have a charger for 18650 batteries.

The Duality is a high-quality butane torch lighter. It has a pocket-proof ignition and a single or double flame to choose from depending on your preference. It also features a large tank window that allows you to keep an eye on the fuel level, as well as making it easy to refill it without issue. The flame can be adjusted with the dial at the bottom and the flint ignition can be replaced if it gets worn out.
It ships empty so you need to add butane gas to it before you can use it.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Intended for use with: DynaVap B, DynaVap M, DynaVap M+ (Plus), DynaVap Omni and DynaVap VonG (i): Titanium.

Cyclone Triple Torch

Cyclone Triple Torch
£11
£15
The Vertigo Cyclone Triple Torch is one of the most budget friendly torch lighters you will ever find. It features a large, clear fuel tank so you’ll always know how much fuel remains and it also makes refilling it a lot easier. The wind resistant flame is capable of lighting at 3'500 meters above sea level.
Fill it with filtered butane gas, available at hobby stores and Amazon, before use (not included). We recommend using the brand Colibri but any butane gas that has been filtered at least five times should work well.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Do not clean the Cyclone Triple Torch with alcohol as this will degrade the plastic, resulting in fuel leaks.

Titanium construction for ultimate durability
Fully adjustable airflow
Ultra-compact design
Can reach vaping temp in seconds
Manual heating - no batteries and no charging
Audible temperature notification (click sound)
Made in the USA
Who is the VapCap Omni for?
The Omni is the top-of-the-line vape manufactured by DynaVap and comes with many smart features that both make it easy to use, but also allows for a lot of customisability. Even though it’s ultra-compact, it still has a fully adjustable airflow, adjustable bowl size and a cap that audibly “clicks” when it has reached the temperature necessary for vaping.
It’s perfect for those looking for a reliable and near-indestructible vaporizer that’s extremely convenient to bring. As it’s heated manually you never have to worry about batteries or charging. Simply bring a lighter with you and you are ready to use the Omni whenever - and wherever - you want.
What’s the difference between “M” and Omni?
Even though both the M and the Omni produce flavourful vapour, there are two big differences between them; the construction material and the ability to adjust the airflow.
On the Omni, the body, tip and mouthpiece are made of the nearly indestructible material titanium while the heating cap is made from stainless steel. On the M, everything is made of stainless steel. The titanium makes the Omni 60% lighter and more durable.
If you like to experiment with draw resistance, you will appreciate that the Omni comes with the ability to adjust the airflow. Increase the airflow to get a lot of vapour quickly, for those times you’re in a hurry, or decrease it for those slower, relaxing sessions.
Great for microdosing
The adjustable titanium bowl of the Omni holds between 0.025 and 0.1 grams of dry herb. You don’t need much herbs at all to feel the effects as the heating process is surprisingly effective. Thanks to the simplicity and ingenuity of the design it’s also easy to reload if you decide you need some more.
Manual heating
Heating up the VapCap Omni is easy, all you have to do is either hold the cap over a flame from a lighter or insert it into an induction heating device. Once you hear the “click” it has reached the temperature for vaping (150 to 230°C). The temperature is adjustable by which section of the cap you decide to heat. After around 30 seconds, you will hear a second “click” which is Omni’s way of letting you know it’s time to heat it again.
Quick and efficient
The heating process takes less than 10 seconds from start, and even quicker between loads which means you never have to wait long to get started with a session. If you get distracted while vaping, don’t worry, the Omni only heats your herbs when you are drawing in the vapour.
Customisable vapour
Get the exact vapour you want in every draw thanks to Omni’s manual heating and adjustable airflow, visualized by the dial-indicator. Depending on where you heat the cap and how much airflow you choose, you can get light, flavourful hits or thick satisfying heavy clouds.
Ultra-compact
As the Omni is free from batteries and electronics its size is extremely impressive. Measuring 109 mm in length and 45 mm in width with a weight of just 20 grams it’s smaller than the average pen and is guaranteed to fit in even the smallest pockets.
Warranty
All DynaVap Omni vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DynaVap products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Features
Induction heating
Great at heating DynaVap vaporizers
Full temperature control (120°C to 425°C)
Borosilicate glass cups
Removable batteries (2 × 2900 mAh)
Safety features
The Wand by Ispire is a portable induction heater for use with concentrates, and in addition to that, it’s also great at heating the tips of DynaVap vaporizers.
What is induction heat?
Induction heat is a highly accurate, controllable, and more predictable heat source than the torches used normally used for this kind of vaping, so you’re going to experience consistency and less waste by eliminating over- or under-heating. Select any temperature you want in 5-degree increments, from 120°C to 425°C.
Wand Glass Adapter for DynaVap vaporizers
If you plan on using the Wand with a DynaVap vaporizer, we recommend getting the Wand Glass Adapter so you can lodge the tip instead of having to swirl it around for even heat. With it, you no longer need to keep an eye on it and can use it hands-free. Just sit back and wait for the “click” of the Captive Cap.
Automatic and manual mode
You can use it in one of two modes, either manual mode or automatic mode. To use it in manual mode, hold the large button down until the cup or your DynaVap reaches your set temperature.
When you first hold the button down the Wand will blink with a red light, then once you put over something metal it will engage the induction heating and pulse a white light while it’s heating up. When it arrives at your set temperature the white light will stay on, meaning you can go ahead and enjoy whatever you're heating.
To use it in automatic mode, double press the large button, and then place it on the induction cup or put your DynaVap in it. One great thing about the automatic mode is that you can take it off and on throughout the cycle and it will just re-engage the heating, so you can sort of feather the heat while in use.
Removable batteries
The Wand is powered by two replaceable 2900 mAh batteries that can be charged with the included USB-C cable, or externally if you have a charger for 18650 batteries.

Duality Torch

The Duality is a high-quality butane torch lighter. It has a pocket-proof ignition and a single or double flame to choose from depending on your preference. It also features a large tank window that allows you to keep an eye on the fuel level, as well as making it easy to refill it without issue. The flame can be adjusted with the dial at the bottom and the flint ignition can be replaced if it gets worn out.
It ships empty so you need to add butane gas to it before you can use it.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Intended for use with: DynaVap B, DynaVap M, DynaVap M+ (Plus), DynaVap Omni and DynaVap VonG (i): Titanium.

Cyclone Triple Torch

Cyclone Triple Torch
£11
£15
The Vertigo Cyclone Triple Torch is one of the most budget friendly torch lighters you will ever find. It features a large, clear fuel tank so you’ll always know how much fuel remains and it also makes refilling it a lot easier. The wind resistant flame is capable of lighting at 3'500 meters above sea level.
Fill it with filtered butane gas, available at hobby stores and Amazon, before use (not included). We recommend using the brand Colibri but any butane gas that has been filtered at least five times should work well.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Do not clean the Cyclone Triple Torch with alcohol as this will degrade the plastic, resulting in fuel leaks.

Titanium construction for ultimate durability
Fully adjustable airflow
Ultra-compact design
Can reach vaping temp in seconds
Manual heating - no batteries and no charging
Audible temperature notification (click sound)
Made in the USA
Who is the VapCap Omni for?
The Omni is the top-of-the-line vape manufactured by DynaVap and comes with many smart features that both make it easy to use, but also allows for a lot of customisability. Even though it’s ultra-compact, it still has a fully adjustable airflow, adjustable bowl size and a cap that audibly “clicks” when it has reached the temperature necessary for vaping.
It’s perfect for those looking for a reliable and near-indestructible vaporizer that’s extremely convenient to bring. As it’s heated manually you never have to worry about batteries or charging. Simply bring a lighter with you and you are ready to use the Omni whenever - and wherever - you want.
What’s the difference between “M” and Omni?
Even though both the M and the Omni produce flavourful vapour, there are two big differences between them; the construction material and the ability to adjust the airflow.
On the Omni, the body, tip and mouthpiece are made of the nearly indestructible material titanium while the heating cap is made from stainless steel. On the M, everything is made of stainless steel. The titanium makes the Omni 60% lighter and more durable.
If you like to experiment with draw resistance, you will appreciate that the Omni comes with the ability to adjust the airflow. Increase the airflow to get a lot of vapour quickly, for those times you’re in a hurry, or decrease it for those slower, relaxing sessions.
Great for microdosing
The adjustable titanium bowl of the Omni holds between 0.025 and 0.1 grams of dry herb. You don’t need much herbs at all to feel the effects as the heating process is surprisingly effective. Thanks to the simplicity and ingenuity of the design it’s also easy to reload if you decide you need some more.
Manual heating
Heating up the VapCap Omni is easy, all you have to do is either hold the cap over a flame from a lighter or insert it into an induction heating device. Once you hear the “click” it has reached the temperature for vaping (150 to 230°C). The temperature is adjustable by which section of the cap you decide to heat. After around 30 seconds, you will hear a second “click” which is Omni’s way of letting you know it’s time to heat it again.
Quick and efficient
The heating process takes less than 10 seconds from start, and even quicker between loads which means you never have to wait long to get started with a session. If you get distracted while vaping, don’t worry, the Omni only heats your herbs when you are drawing in the vapour.
Customisable vapour
Get the exact vapour you want in every draw thanks to Omni’s manual heating and adjustable airflow, visualized by the dial-indicator. Depending on where you heat the cap and how much airflow you choose, you can get light, flavourful hits or thick satisfying heavy clouds.
Ultra-compact
As the Omni is free from batteries and electronics its size is extremely impressive. Measuring 109 mm in length and 45 mm in width with a weight of just 20 grams it’s smaller than the average pen and is guaranteed to fit in even the smallest pockets.
Warranty
All DynaVap Omni vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DynaVap products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)

Ispire - The Wand (Induction Heater)
£89
£119
Features
Induction heating
Great at heating DynaVap vaporizers
Full temperature control (120°C to 425°C)
Borosilicate glass cups
Removable batteries (2 × 2900 mAh)
Safety features
The Wand by Ispire is a portable induction heater for use with concentrates, and in addition to that, it’s also great at heating the tips of DynaVap vaporizers.
What is induction heat?
Induction heat is a highly accurate, controllable, and more predictable heat source than the torches used normally used for this kind of vaping, so you’re going to experience consistency and less waste by eliminating over- or under-heating. Select any temperature you want in 5-degree increments, from 120°C to 425°C.
Wand Glass Adapter for DynaVap vaporizers
If you plan on using the Wand with a DynaVap vaporizer, we recommend getting the Wand Glass Adapter so you can lodge the tip instead of having to swirl it around for even heat. With it, you no longer need to keep an eye on it and can use it hands-free. Just sit back and wait for the “click” of the Captive Cap.
Automatic and manual mode
You can use it in one of two modes, either manual mode or automatic mode. To use it in manual mode, hold the large button down until the cup or your DynaVap reaches your set temperature.
When you first hold the button down the Wand will blink with a red light, then once you put over something metal it will engage the induction heating and pulse a white light while it’s heating up. When it arrives at your set temperature the white light will stay on, meaning you can go ahead and enjoy whatever you're heating.
To use it in automatic mode, double press the large button, and then place it on the induction cup or put your DynaVap in it. One great thing about the automatic mode is that you can take it off and on throughout the cycle and it will just re-engage the heating, so you can sort of feather the heat while in use.
Removable batteries
The Wand is powered by two replaceable 2900 mAh batteries that can be charged with the included USB-C cable, or externally if you have a charger for 18650 batteries.

Duality Torch
£29
£38
The Duality is a high-quality butane torch lighter. It has a pocket-proof ignition and a single or double flame to choose from depending on your preference. It also features a large tank window that allows you to keep an eye on the fuel level, as well as making it easy to refill it without issue. The flame can be adjusted with the dial at the bottom and the flint ignition can be replaced if it gets worn out.
It ships empty so you need to add butane gas to it before you can use it.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Intended for use with: DynaVap B, DynaVap M, DynaVap M+ (Plus), DynaVap Omni and DynaVap VonG (i): Titanium.

Cyclone Triple Torch
£11
£15
The Vertigo Cyclone Triple Torch is one of the most budget friendly torch lighters you will ever find. It features a large, clear fuel tank so you’ll always know how much fuel remains and it also makes refilling it a lot easier. The wind resistant flame is capable of lighting at 3'500 meters above sea level.
Fill it with filtered butane gas, available at hobby stores and Amazon, before use (not included). We recommend using the brand Colibri but any butane gas that has been filtered at least five times should work well.
Please note that regular lighter gas (propane), is not compatible with torches. Torches need filtered butane gas to deliver their high performance.
Do not clean the Cyclone Triple Torch with alcohol as this will degrade the plastic, resulting in fuel leaks.

Titanium construction for ultimate durability
Fully adjustable airflow
Ultra-compact design
Can reach vaping temp in seconds
Manual heating - no batteries and no charging
Audible temperature notification (click sound)
Made in the USA
Who is the VapCap Omni for?
The Omni is the top-of-the-line vape manufactured by DynaVap and comes with many smart features that both make it easy to use, but also allows for a lot of customisability. Even though it’s ultra-compact, it still has a fully adjustable airflow, adjustable bowl size and a cap that audibly “clicks” when it has reached the temperature necessary for vaping.
It’s perfect for those looking for a reliable and near-indestructible vaporizer that’s extremely convenient to bring. As it’s heated manually you never have to worry about batteries or charging. Simply bring a lighter with you and you are ready to use the Omni whenever - and wherever - you want.
What’s the difference between “M” and Omni?
Even though both the M and the Omni produce flavourful vapour, there are two big differences between them; the construction material and the ability to adjust the airflow.
On the Omni, the body, tip and mouthpiece are made of the nearly indestructible material titanium while the heating cap is made from stainless steel. On the M, everything is made of stainless steel. The titanium makes the Omni 60% lighter and more durable.
If you like to experiment with draw resistance, you will appreciate that the Omni comes with the ability to adjust the airflow. Increase the airflow to get a lot of vapour quickly, for those times you’re in a hurry, or decrease it for those slower, relaxing sessions.
Great for microdosing
The adjustable titanium bowl of the Omni holds between 0.025 and 0.1 grams of dry herb. You don’t need much herbs at all to feel the effects as the heating process is surprisingly effective. Thanks to the simplicity and ingenuity of the design it’s also easy to reload if you decide you need some more.
Manual heating
Heating up the VapCap Omni is easy, all you have to do is either hold the cap over a flame from a lighter or insert it into an induction heating device. Once you hear the “click” it has reached the temperature for vaping (150 to 230°C). The temperature is adjustable by which section of the cap you decide to heat. After around 30 seconds, you will hear a second “click” which is Omni’s way of letting you know it’s time to heat it again.
Quick and efficient
The heating process takes less than 10 seconds from start, and even quicker between loads which means you never have to wait long to get started with a session. If you get distracted while vaping, don’t worry, the Omni only heats your herbs when you are drawing in the vapour.
Customisable vapour
Get the exact vapour you want in every draw thanks to Omni’s manual heating and adjustable airflow, visualized by the dial-indicator. Depending on where you heat the cap and how much airflow you choose, you can get light, flavourful hits or thick satisfying heavy clouds.
Ultra-compact
As the Omni is free from batteries and electronics its size is extremely impressive. Measuring 109 mm in length and 45 mm in width with a weight of just 20 grams it’s smaller than the average pen and is guaranteed to fit in even the smallest pockets.
Warranty
All DynaVap Omni vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of DynaVap products, are authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty, restricted to normal use.

Who is the Flowermate V5 Nano for?
Ideal for beginners and those who simply want a no-hassle vaporizer that’s both efficient and good value for money, the Flowermate V5 Nano is not to be missed. Sleek in design and superbly discreet due to its pocket-sized nature and simplistic design, this vape is perfect to be taken on-the-go for a quick hit when out and about. Its easy-to-use controls and full temperature control allow you to fully tailor your vaping experience, without being forced to navigate complex button panels.
Quality Vapour
With its top quality ceramic chamber, glass mouthpiece and isolated air path, the vapour produced by the Flowermate V5 Nano is incredibly impressive. Pure in flavour and bypassing all electronics within the device, your vapour will never be tainted by metallic tastes or harmful toxins. And as the mouthpiece is made of glass, its non-porous surface provides premium hygiene and a superbly luxurious feel.
Removable Battery
Whilst the battery life of the Flowermate V5 Nano isn’t the best by (up to 50 minutes of continuous vaping production) it does have a swappable battery which means that if you are prepared you never have to cut a vaping session short! Instead of waiting for the battery to charge, you can instantly swap to a charged battery to keep your session going.
Fast Heating Time
Able to heat-up and reach maximum temperature in just 30 – 50 seconds, the Flowermate V5 Nano makes quick hits easy. Allowing you to begin vaping after waiting just a mere few moments for the device to heat up, you’ll never be left feeling frustrated and bored waiting for your vaporizer to begin reaching your desired temperature level.
Easy to Clean
Due to the simplistic structure of the Flowermate V5 Nano, achieving a full clean requires little time or maintenance. Only the oven, LED screen and glass mouthpiece require a simple brush after use, or a quick swipe with pure alcohol for a deeper clean. Better still, the wide shape of the mouthpiece means getting inside with a cotton bud won’t be a challenge.
Full Temperature Control
Allowing you to select any temperature between 40°C and 230°C as opposed to only having a few pre-set temperatures to choose from, the Flowermate V5 Nano provides complete control over your session’s temperature. Its simple operation allows you to easily switch-up the temperature at the mere touch of a button, whilst its LED display provides accurate temperature readings at all times.
Warranty
All Flowermate V5 Nano vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Flowermate (by Smiss), are completely authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty on the device and a 1-year warranty on the battery.

Who is the Flowermate V5 Nano for?
Ideal for beginners and those who simply want a no-hassle vaporizer that’s both efficient and good value for money, the Flowermate V5 Nano is not to be missed. Sleek in design and superbly discreet due to its pocket-sized nature and simplistic design, this vape is perfect to be taken on-the-go for a quick hit when out and about. Its easy-to-use controls and full temperature control allow you to fully tailor your vaping experience, without being forced to navigate complex button panels.
Quality Vapour
With its top quality ceramic chamber, glass mouthpiece and isolated air path, the vapour produced by the Flowermate V5 Nano is incredibly impressive. Pure in flavour and bypassing all electronics within the device, your vapour will never be tainted by metallic tastes or harmful toxins. And as the mouthpiece is made of glass, its non-porous surface provides premium hygiene and a superbly luxurious feel.
Removable Battery
Whilst the battery life of the Flowermate V5 Nano isn’t the best by (up to 50 minutes of continuous vaping production) it does have a swappable battery which means that if you are prepared you never have to cut a vaping session short! Instead of waiting for the battery to charge, you can instantly swap to a charged battery to keep your session going.
Fast Heating Time
Able to heat-up and reach maximum temperature in just 30 – 50 seconds, the Flowermate V5 Nano makes quick hits easy. Allowing you to begin vaping after waiting just a mere few moments for the device to heat up, you’ll never be left feeling frustrated and bored waiting for your vaporizer to begin reaching your desired temperature level.
Easy to Clean
Due to the simplistic structure of the Flowermate V5 Nano, achieving a full clean requires little time or maintenance. Only the oven, LED screen and glass mouthpiece require a simple brush after use, or a quick swipe with pure alcohol for a deeper clean. Better still, the wide shape of the mouthpiece means getting inside with a cotton bud won’t be a challenge.
Full Temperature Control
Allowing you to select any temperature between 40°C and 230°C as opposed to only having a few pre-set temperatures to choose from, the Flowermate V5 Nano provides complete control over your session’s temperature. Its simple operation allows you to easily switch-up the temperature at the mere touch of a button, whilst its LED display provides accurate temperature readings at all times.
Warranty
All Flowermate V5 Nano vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Flowermate (by Smiss), are completely authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty on the device and a 1-year warranty on the battery.

Featuring an innovative stainless steel air path and hybrid heating, the premium taste of your herbs is always protected. Guaranteed never to taste unpleasant or metallic and specifically designed with utmost quality in mind with every single hit, impressive vapour clouds can be created with ease.
Swappable Battery
Whilst the accompanying 18650 battery can provide an impressive 75 minutes of quality vaping time, sometimes you just want a longer session. Luckily, you can simply swap out your battery for a fully-charged one, meaning the only usage limitations you’ll experience here are the amount of batteries you can carry along.
Better still, this vaporizer has an innovative automatic shutdown timer if inactivity is experienced for a prolonged period of time. Helping save essential battery life if you happen to fall asleep or get distracted, the reliability of the Arizer ArGo is very impressive.
Heats Up in Just 60 Seconds
Able to achieve a medium-range heat in just 60 seconds and reach its maximum heat of 220°C in just 90, you’ll never be forced to annoyingly wait around for your vape to heat up. Efficient and quick, experiencing a relaxing session at a moment’s notice is easy with the Arizer ArGo.
Warranty
The ArGo carries a lifetime warranty on the heating element and a limited 2-year warranty covering defects in materials or workmanship, excluding the battery.

Who is the Fenix 2.0 Vaporizer for?
A notable upgrade to its successful predecessor, the Fenix 2.0 Vaporizer offers the perfect balance of cutting-edge technology with smart design. A great choice for those seeking a top-performing portable vaporizer with full control over their sessions, this vape is hailed for its innovative systems and great tasting vapour. Specifically designed to vaporize dry herbs and the first vaporizer on the market allowing you to set a precise session time, the Fenix 2.0 guarantees a quality experience every time.
Top Technology
The Fenix 2.0 boasts incredibly impressive heating and cooling systems, guaranteeing premium quality taste every single time. Utilizing a convection heating method to successfully heat your herbs evenly without risk of burning, the innovation of this method is able to extract greater active substances from your herbs than many other portable vaporizers on the market. Resulting in high-impact, smooth tasting vapour every single time, the clouds produced are thick and satisfying due to this vape’s rapid cooling methods.
Full Temperature Control
Unlike many other portable vaporizers only offering pre-set temperatures that can feel a little restrictive (especially for seasoned vapers), the Fenix 2.0 allows you to select the precise temperature you desire. Giving you the power to select an exact heat ranging all the way from 160°C to 220°C, you have full control over your session’s power. And regardless of which temperature you choose, the Fenix 2.0 is able to fully heat-up in just 30 seconds, meaning you’ll never be left waiting around for your session to begin.
Session Timing
Perhaps the most stand-out feature of all, the Fenix 2.0 is hailed as the first vaporizer in the world to allow session timing. Possessing a nifty session time adjuster, you can pre-set precisely how long you want your session to last before you begin. Then, once your chosen time is up, the device will automatically switch itself off to ensure you only experience your pre-selected time span. Allowing you to have full control over your session before it even begins, you’re eliminating the risk of overrunning and wasting battery life.
Impressive Battery
The Fenix 2.0 comes equipped with a super high capacity 4400 mAh battery. Fully rechargeable in just 2.5 – 3 hours despite its large size, this battery can last for up to a huge 75 minutes from a full charge. Offering up to twice the longevity of many other portable vaporizers on the market, you can be rest assured the battery life of the Fenix 2.0 won’t let you down. And when power does start to run dry, the useful OLED screen will display full battery status at all times – giving you an accurate heads-up as to when your device may need to be charged.
Warranty
All Fenix 2.0 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Weecke, are completely authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty.

Who is the Fenix 2.0 Vaporizer for?
A notable upgrade to its successful predecessor, the Fenix 2.0 Vaporizer offers the perfect balance of cutting-edge technology with smart design. A great choice for those seeking a top-performing portable vaporizer with full control over their sessions, this vape is hailed for its innovative systems and great tasting vapour. Specifically designed to vaporize dry herbs and the first vaporizer on the market allowing you to set a precise session time, the Fenix 2.0 guarantees a quality experience every time.
Top Technology
The Fenix 2.0 boasts incredibly impressive heating and cooling systems, guaranteeing premium quality taste every single time. Utilizing a convection heating method to successfully heat your herbs evenly without risk of burning, the innovation of this method is able to extract greater active substances from your herbs than many other portable vaporizers on the market. Resulting in high-impact, smooth tasting vapour every single time, the clouds produced are thick and satisfying due to this vape’s rapid cooling methods.
Full Temperature Control
Unlike many other portable vaporizers only offering pre-set temperatures that can feel a little restrictive (especially for seasoned vapers), the Fenix 2.0 allows you to select the precise temperature you desire. Giving you the power to select an exact heat ranging all the way from 160°C to 220°C, you have full control over your session’s power. And regardless of which temperature you choose, the Fenix 2.0 is able to fully heat-up in just 30 seconds, meaning you’ll never be left waiting around for your session to begin.
Session Timing
Perhaps the most stand-out feature of all, the Fenix 2.0 is hailed as the first vaporizer in the world to allow session timing. Possessing a nifty session time adjuster, you can pre-set precisely how long you want your session to last before you begin. Then, once your chosen time is up, the device will automatically switch itself off to ensure you only experience your pre-selected time span. Allowing you to have full control over your session before it even begins, you’re eliminating the risk of overrunning and wasting battery life.
Impressive Battery
The Fenix 2.0 comes equipped with a super high capacity 4400 mAh battery. Fully rechargeable in just 2.5 – 3 hours despite its large size, this battery can last for up to a huge 75 minutes from a full charge. Offering up to twice the longevity of many other portable vaporizers on the market, you can be rest assured the battery life of the Fenix 2.0 won’t let you down. And when power does start to run dry, the useful OLED screen will display full battery status at all times – giving you an accurate heads-up as to when your device may need to be charged.
Warranty
All Fenix 2.0 vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers, an authorised distributor of Weecke, are completely authentic and backed by a 2-year warranty.

Who is the Fenix 2.0 Vaporizer for?
A notable upgrade to its successful predecessor, the Fenix 2.0 Vaporizer offers the perfect balance of cutting-edge technology with smart design. A great choice for those seeking a top-performing portable vaporizer with full control over their sessions, this vape is hailed for its innovative systems and great tasting vapour. Specifically designed to vaporize dry herbs and the first vaporizer on the market allowing you to set a precise session time, the Fenix 2.0 guarantees a quality experience every time.
Top Technology
The Fenix 2.0 boasts incredibly impressive heating and cooling systems, guaranteeing premium quality taste every single time. Utilizing a convection heating method to successfully heat your herbs evenly without risk of burning, the innovation of this method is able to extract greater active substances from your herbs than many other portable vaporizers on the market. Resulting in high-impact, smooth tasting vapour every single time, the clouds produced are thick and satisfying due to this vape’s rapid cooling methods.
Full Temperature Control
Unlike many other portable vaporizers only offering pre-set temperatures that can feel a little restrictive (especially for seasoned vapers), the Fenix 2.0 allows you to select the precise temperature you desire. Giving you the power to select an exact heat ranging all the way from 160°C to 220°C, you have full control over your session’s power. And regardless of which temperature you choose, the Fenix 2.0 is able to fully heat-up in just 30 seconds, meaning you’ll never be left waiting around for your session to begin.
Session Timing
Perhaps the most stand-out feature of all, the Fenix 2.0 is hailed as the first vaporizer in the world to allow session timing. Possessing a nifty session time adjuster, you can pre-set precisely how long you want your session to last before you begin. Then, once your chosen time is up, the device will automatically switch itself off to ensure you only experience your pre-selected time span. Allowing you to have full control over your session before it even begins, you’re eliminating the risk of overrunning and wasting battery life.
Impressive Battery
The Fenix 2.0 comes equipped with a super high capacity 4400 mAh battery. Fully rechargeable in just 2.5 – 3 hours despite its large size, this battery can last for up to a huge 75 minutes from a full charge. Offering up to twice the longevity of many other portable vaporizers on the market, you can be rest assured the battery life of the Fenix 2.0 won’t let you down. And when power does start to run dry, the useful OLED screen will display full battery status at all times – giving you an accurate heads-up as to when your device may need to be charged.
Warranty

Who is the FocusVape Pro S for?
With its powerful features and lightweight design, the FocusVape Pro S is the perfect choice if you’re looking for more than many standard portable vapes can provide. Offering incredibly precise temperature adjustment and customisable airflow, you have full power over the smoothness and density of the vapour you inhale. Allowing you to have complete control over your entire vaping experience, this Premium version of the FocusVape Pro S comes equipped with a unique bubbler attachment to replicate the cooling feel and sound of a bong.
Fully Customisable
The FocusVape Pro S allows you to customise both the consistency and flavour of your vapour. By matching how thorough you have ground your herbs, you can easily adjust the heat to personalise the strength of flavour you experience. Better still, this vaporizer boasts cutting-edge airflow control that monitors precisely how much air is drawn into the chamber and combined with the herb vapour. By altering this function, you can effortlessly customise the density of the vapour clouds you experience for a truly personalised session every time.
Precise Temperature Control
Unlike many other vaporizers that simply offer pre-set temperatures for you to choose from, you have total control over the degree of heat you experience. Providing a temperature range of 80°C to 240°C, you can select any degree within this bracket without compromising on performance or heat-up time.
Impressive Performance
Weighing just 180 g and portable, it would make sense to assume the FocusVape Pro S may not provide the degree of high performance you may be looking for. However, due to the impressively high-grade materials and technology used to create this vape, the isolated air path, triple filtration system and deep combustion-free chamber guarantee superb performance and great taste with every draw.
High Capacity Battery
The FocusVape Pro S is equipped with one of the highest capacity batteries found on the portable vape market. Complete with a built-in 3200 mAh 18650 battery, you’re guaranteed to experience long sessions every time. And as this battery is replaceable, you can easily switch it out for a fully-charged model if you find your session has lasted longer than expected. Or alternatively, the innovative pass-through technology of the FocusVape Pro S allows you to use the device while it’s being charged! Superbly flexible and adaptable, this vaporizer won’t let you down.
Premium Bubbler Attachment
You’ll receive a bong-style bubbler attachment as part of the FocusVape Pro S Premium kit, providing a whole new vaping sensation for you to experience. Specifically designed and included to replicate the bubbling sound, taste and cooling sensation of a bong, this attachment is super easy to attach and use. Simply fill with water, snap onto the device and you’re good to go!
Warranty
All FocusVape Pro S Premium vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty.

Who is the FocusVape Pro S for?
With its powerful features and lightweight design, the FocusVape Pro S is the perfect choice if you’re looking for more than many standard portable vapes can provide. Offering incredibly precise temperature adjustment and customisable airflow, you have full power over the smoothness and density of the vapour you inhale. Allowing you to have complete control over your entire vaping experience, this Premium version of the FocusVape Pro S comes equipped with a unique bubbler attachment to replicate the cooling feel and sound of a bong.
Fully Customisable
The FocusVape Pro S allows you to customise both the consistency and flavour of your vapour. By matching how thorough you have ground your herbs, you can easily adjust the heat to personalise the strength of flavour you experience. Better still, this vaporizer boasts cutting-edge airflow control that monitors precisely how much air is drawn into the chamber and combined with the herb vapour. By altering this function, you can effortlessly customise the density of the vapour clouds you experience for a truly personalised session every time.
Precise Temperature Control
Unlike many other vaporizers that simply offer pre-set temperatures for you to choose from, you have total control over the degree of heat you experience. Providing a temperature range of 80°C to 240°C, you can select any degree within this bracket without compromising on performance or heat-up time.
Impressive Performance
Weighing just 180 g and portable, it would make sense to assume the FocusVape Pro S may not provide the degree of high performance you may be looking for. However, due to the impressively high-grade materials and technology used to create this vape, the isolated air path, triple filtration system and deep combustion-free chamber guarantee superb performance and great taste with every draw.
High Capacity Battery
The FocusVape Pro S is equipped with one of the highest capacity batteries found on the portable vape market. Complete with a built-in 3200 mAh 18650 battery, you’re guaranteed to experience long sessions every time. And as this battery is replaceable, you can easily switch it out for a fully-charged model if you find your session has lasted longer than expected. Or alternatively, the innovative pass-through technology of the FocusVape Pro S allows you to use the device while it’s being charged! Superbly flexible and adaptable, this vaporizer won’t let you down.
Premium Bubbler Attachment
You’ll receive a bong-style bubbler attachment as part of the FocusVape Pro S Premium kit, providing a whole new vaping sensation for you to experience. Specifically designed and included to replicate the bubbling sound, taste and cooling sensation of a bong, this attachment is super easy to attach and use. Simply fill with water, snap onto the device and you’re good to go!
Warranty
All FocusVape Pro S Premium vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty.

Who is the FocusVape Pro S for?
With its powerful features and lightweight design, the FocusVape Pro S is the perfect choice if you’re looking for more than many standard portable vapes can provide. Offering incredibly precise temperature adjustment and customisable airflow, you have full power over the smoothness and density of the vapour you inhale. Allowing you to have complete control over your entire vaping experience, this Premium version of the FocusVape Pro S comes equipped with a unique bubbler attachment to replicate the cooling feel and sound of a bong.
Fully Customisable
The FocusVape Pro S allows you to customise both the consistency and flavour of your vapour. By matching how thorough you have ground your herbs, you can easily adjust the heat to personalise the strength of flavour you experience. Better still, this vaporizer boasts cutting-edge airflow control that monitors precisely how much air is drawn into the chamber and combined with the herb vapour. By altering this function, you can effortlessly customise the density of the vapour clouds you experience for a truly personalised session every time.
Precise Temperature Control
Unlike many other vaporizers that simply offer pre-set temperatures for you to choose from, you have total control over the degree of heat you experience. Providing a temperature range of 80°C to 240°C, you can select any degree within this bracket without compromising on performance or heat-up time.
Impressive Performance
Weighing just 180 g and portable, it would make sense to assume the FocusVape Pro S may not provide the degree of high performance you may be looking for. However, due to the impressively high-grade materials and technology used to create this vape, the isolated air path, triple filtration system and deep combustion-free chamber guarantee superb performance and great taste with every draw.
High Capacity Battery
The FocusVape Pro S is equipped with one of the highest capacity batteries found on the portable vape market. Complete with a built-in 3200 mAh 18650 battery, you’re guaranteed to experience long sessions every time. And as this battery is replaceable, you can easily switch it out for a fully-charged model if you find your session has lasted longer than expected. Or alternatively, the innovative pass-through technology of the FocusVape Pro S allows you to use the device while it’s being charged! Superbly flexible and adaptable, this vaporizer won’t let you down.
Premium Bubbler Attachment
You’ll receive a bong-style bubbler attachment as part of the FocusVape Pro S Premium kit, providing a whole new vaping sensation for you to experience. Specifically designed and included to replicate the bubbling sound, taste and cooling sensation of a bong, this attachment is super easy to attach and use. Simply fill with water, snap onto the device and you’re good to go!
Warranty
All FocusVape Pro S Premium vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty.

Who is the FocusVape Pro S for?
With its powerful features and lightweight design, the FocusVape Pro S is the perfect choice if you’re looking for more than many standard portable vapes can provide. Offering incredibly precise temperature adjustment and customisable airflow, you have full power over the smoothness and density of the vapour you inhale. Allowing you to have complete control over your entire vaping experience, this Premium version of the FocusVape Pro S comes equipped with a unique bubbler attachment to replicate the cooling feel and sound of a bong.
Fully Customisable
The FocusVape Pro S allows you to customise both the consistency and flavour of your vapour. By matching how thorough you have ground your herbs, you can easily adjust the heat to personalise the strength of flavour you experience. Better still, this vaporizer boasts cutting-edge airflow control that monitors precisely how much air is drawn into the chamber and combined with the herb vapour. By altering this function, you can effortlessly customise the density of the vapour clouds you experience for a truly personalised session every time.
Precise Temperature Control
Unlike many other vaporizers that simply offer pre-set temperatures for you to choose from, you have total control over the degree of heat you experience. Providing a temperature range of 80°C to 240°C, you can select any degree within this bracket without compromising on performance or heat-up time.
Impressive Performance
Weighing just 180 g and portable, it would make sense to assume the FocusVape Pro S may not provide the degree of high performance you may be looking for. However, due to the impressively high-grade materials and technology used to create this vape, the isolated air path, triple filtration system and deep combustion-free chamber guarantee superb performance and great taste with every draw.
High Capacity Battery
The FocusVape Pro S is equipped with one of the highest capacity batteries found on the portable vape market. Complete with a built-in 3200 mAh 18650 battery, you’re guaranteed to experience long sessions every time. And as this battery is replaceable, you can easily switch it out for a fully-charged model if you find your session has lasted longer than expected. Or alternatively, the innovative pass-through technology of the FocusVape Pro S allows you to use the device while it’s being charged! Superbly flexible and adaptable, this vaporizer won’t let you down.
Premium Bubbler Attachment
You’ll receive a bong-style bubbler attachment as part of the FocusVape Pro S Premium kit, providing a whole new vaping sensation for you to experience. Specifically designed and included to replicate the bubbling sound, taste and cooling sensation of a bong, this attachment is super easy to attach and use. Simply fill with water, snap onto the device and you’re good to go!
Warranty
All FocusVape Pro S Premium vaporizers sold by MagicVaporizers are completely authentic and backed by a 1-year warranty.
