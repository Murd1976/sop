Description: If the Glass Lining on your Tinymight 2 heater breaks, don't worry - it's an easy fix with this spare part. Simply use a screwdriver to remove the big screw at the back end of the heater and take off the bottom panel. Insert the screwdriver into the hole and turn it about 15 times to loosen the screw that holds the top panel in place. Once the screw is loose, you can remove the top panel and replace the broken glass lining. When putting everything back together, make sure to tighten the internal screw first, and then the long screw, to keep the glass lining in place.

Product: Magnetic USB-C Adapter
Price: £11 - £15
Description: Make charging easier and extend the longevity of your vaporizer by using this Magnetic USB-C Adapter. All you have to do is attach one part of the adapter to your vaporizer, and the other part of it to a USB-C cable. The two parts then connect easily through magnetic force and your vaporizer acts as if it was plugged in normally, but without any force of insertion needed (and it can be done with only one hand!). The USB port is usually the most sensitive area for mechanical errors due to wear and tear, so by using this adapter you can ensure that your vaporizer will be better protected from any damage to the port. This Magnetic USB-C Adapter is compatible with all types of vaporizers and can be used with any USB-

What's the difference between XMax V2 Pro and V3 Pro?:
The XMax V3 Pro is smaller than the original V2 and also has a smaller chamber but it is still enough for one session (0.15 g) so you do not have to think about reloading immediately. Another difference is the convection heating, which shortens the heating time by 80% and means that V3 Pro vape gets more of your herbs.
